5/28/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: To all fellow fighters in the U.S., you shall remember not to lie or make false testimonies at any time. No matter what issues or situations you are facing, calm down and do not listen to the noises around you or follow the so-called advice from your friends or relatives in Communist China. The New Federal State of China and the Himalaya Alliance Committee will make sure to protect the rights and benefits of our fellow fighters worldwide in accordance with the law.

5/28/2022 文贵盖特：在美国的战友们一定记住千万不要撒谎造假；无论遇到什么事，要冷静，不要听旁边的杂音或所谓国内亲朋好友的建议；新中国联邦和联盟委员会一定会依法在全球保护战友的利益
