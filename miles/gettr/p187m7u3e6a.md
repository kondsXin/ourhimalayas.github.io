5/3/2022 Miles Guo: When I got out of Qingfeng Detention Center, I was under border control and my name was on the CCP's surveillance list due to my support of the June 4, 1989 event. I was unable to get loans or own any legal entities; However, I was able to regain my strength and rebuild a network within a few months; what was the force pushing me forward? It was my determination to take down the CCP!

5/3/2022 文贵直播：刚刚走出清丰看守所的我受到边控，因为名字在8964管控名单上而无法贷款或拥有法人机构；然而我能在短短的几个月内恢复实力，重建关系网。是什么让我有如此大的动力？是灭共的决心！
