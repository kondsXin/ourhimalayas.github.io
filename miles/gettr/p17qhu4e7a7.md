【Ukraine Rescue】04/26/2022Every Chinese who has fled China has a sad story to tell. Since the Chinese Communist Party seized power, it has been creating havoc and every generation has suffered from it. Nicole's parents were victims of the Cultural Revolution, countless women were forced to have abortions by the so-called family planning policy, and hundreds of millions of babies were killed ...... This must be changed, and we are changing history. (P2-2)

【乌克兰救援】04/26/2022 每一个逃离中国的中国人都有一个悲伤的故事。自中共夺取政权，一直在制造灾难，每一代人都深受其害。妮可的父母是文革受害者，无数妇女被所谓计划生育政策强制流产，数以亿计的婴儿被杀死……这一切必须被改变，而我们正在改变历史。（下）
