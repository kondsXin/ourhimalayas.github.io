In the face of the ongoing shelling of their homeland, the young Ukrainian girls showed courage, strength, and the belief that they would never give up. They were making naturally beautiful headdresses out of dandelion flowers as they took a break from their volunteer work and thanked the New Federal State of China for bringing warm aid and hope to the Ukrainian people when their nation was going through a crisis.

面对家乡正在经历的炮火轰炸，乌克兰年轻女孩表现出了勇敢、坚强和绝不放弃的信念，她们在做义工休息的时候，用蒲公英花朵做成了天然美丽的头饰，她们感谢新中国联邦在她们民族经历危难的时刻给乌克兰人民带来温暖的援助和希望。
