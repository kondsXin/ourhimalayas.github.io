Young volunteers from the United States and Nigeria, part of the organization “Making Difference in Uganda”, came to serve at the Ukrainian Refugee Center in Medyka, Poland. They spoke about their duties, their beliefs about the tragic events in China, and their beliefs about humanitarianism. They were really shocked by how the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) suppressed Hong Kong people, and how the CCP treated the Chinese people during COVID lockdowns. They said we should accept each other as who we are without discrimination, as we are all human, bleeding the same color of blood.

来自美国和尼日利亚的两名青年志愿者，隶属于 "在乌干达创造不同 "组织，来到波兰梅迪卡的乌克兰难民中心服务。他们对中共如何镇压香港人，以及中共在COVID封锁期间如何对待中国人民，真的感到震惊。他们说我们应该无歧视地接受对方的身份，因为我们都是人类，流着同样颜色的血。
