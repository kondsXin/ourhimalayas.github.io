Guido Koppes is an excellent professional photographer, providing news images to many European Medias. When he saw our vests, he started taking pictures. He condemned the unscrupulous Western Medias, big companies and politicians kneeling and licking money and being bought by the CCP, covering up the truth and helping the tyrants, and they brought disaster to the free society of the West.

Guido Koppes是一位优秀的职业摄影师，给欧洲很多媒体提供新闻图片。他看到我们的马甲，就开始拍照，然后火力全开，痛骂西方无良媒体、大公司和政客跪舔金钱被中共收买， 掩盖真相、助纣为虐， 给西方自由社会带来灾难。
