【NFSC 2nd Anniversary 】06/04/2022  Mr. Peter Navarro said that he already pointed out the trade deal that a faction in the White House was trying to make with the Communist China was meaningless. He also found out the trade deficit the U.S. had with China was equal to the CCP military expenses at that time, which means the U.S. was paying for the CCP's expansion. To force the CCP to stop leeching off the world, the U.S. must decouple from the CCP economically

【新中国联邦2周年】06/04/2022：纳瓦罗先生称，他还在白宫时就明确指出白宫一小撮人想和中共达成的贸易协定是一纸空文，并发现美国对中共国的贸易逆差数额正好和中共的军事开支相同，美国在为中共的扩张买单。只有和中共经济脱钩，才能迫使中共停止继续吸血世界。
