5/1/2022 Miles Guo: Once Nancy Pelosi visits Taiwan, the CCP will create conflicts and incite anti-Chinese incidents around the world, so that overseas Chinese are forced to return to Communist China; lockdowns and "Zero COVID" policy are the CCP's means to oppress Lao Baixing, and the ultimate goal is to push for "change of dynasty" and implement a tyrannical imperialism; Chinese people will return to a life of collectivism, no freedom of speech and even curfews!

5/1/2022 文贵直播：一旦Nancy Pelosi访问台湾，共产党会在海外制造事端掀起反华浪潮，迫使海外华人回到中共国；共产党通过隔离清零政策打压老百姓，最终目的是“改朝换代”实行独裁的皇权主义；中国人会重新回到集体供给、没有言论自由，甚至是宵禁的日子！
