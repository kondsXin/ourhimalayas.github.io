6/10/2022 Miles Guo: The celebration of the 2nd anniversary of the New Federal State of China on June 4th is so significant! Unlike the Chinese Communist Party, which brutally massacres and brainwashes its people, the NFSC is working hard to seek the truth for Chinese people and protect their rights and interests and the safety of their families; while the CCP has plunged Lao Baixing into poverty and suffering, the NFSC is willing to share a bright future with its compatriots; while the CCP tried to do harm to us, it has ended up ushering in more opportunities for our NFSC!

6/10/2022 文贵直播：新中国联邦的六四庆典意义重大！不同于中共对老百姓的残酷屠杀和洗脑，新中国联邦努力为同胞寻求真相，保护其权利利益和安全；中共令老百姓陷入贫困和痛苦，我们却愿与同胞分享美好未来；共产党费尽心机搞破坏，反而为新中国联邦迎来更多机会！
