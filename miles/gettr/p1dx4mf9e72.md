6/12/2022 Miles Guo: Although the Chinese Communist Party was tough on the surface, it privately told the U.S. Secretary of Defense that it did not want a large-scale war; the U.S. has given the CCP an ultimatum that once it launches an attack on Taiwan, the U.S. will immediately counterattack without prior notice or further explanation, and there will be sanctions against the CCP's economy and seizure of individual assets. In addition, the US, Japan, Britain, Europe, Australia, and Canada will act jointly until the CCP is wiped out!

6/12/2022 文贵直播：中共虽表面强硬，私下却告诉美国国防部长不想搞大规模战争；美国发出最后通牒，一旦中共对台动武，美国会不通知、不解释，立即反击，并对中共国经济和个人财产进行制裁和查封；另外，美、日、英、欧、澳、加拿大会联合行动，直到把中共铲平！
