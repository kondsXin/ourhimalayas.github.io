5/11/2022 Miles Guo: Putin appeared extremely panicked during the Victory Day Parade. A person who attended the parade told me that the armored vehicles loaded with live ammunition were found to have arrived at the scene. After that, Putin and others fled right away. This means that the Russian elites wanted to take out Putin. Putin does not dare to disclose this matter. Nor does he dare to liquidate, because he is afraid that he will be finished in the process of liquidation. Only the Whistleblowers’ Movement has obtained this intelligence!

5/11/2022 文贵直播：普京在阅兵时表现得极其慌张，参加阅兵的人告诉文贵，发现有带实弹的防弹车进入了现场，普京等人随即撒腿就跑，这说明俄罗斯的精英们想干掉普京，但普京既不敢公开此事，又不敢清算，他害怕自己在清算的过程中完蛋。只有爆料革命掌握了这一情报！
