6/6/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: We will soon face crazy retaliation and challenges from the CCP. Yesterday I told one of my American friends that Mother Jones, the CCP's running dog, would publish an article attacking us, and sure enough this morning there came out an article speaking sarcastically of Peter Navarro's participation in the 2nd anniversary of the New Federal State of China. We don't beg anyone to join the Whistleblowers’ Movement, but we want to save anyone, especially our fellow Chinese.

6/6/2022 文贵盖特：我们将很快面临中共的疯狂报复和挑战；昨天文贵就告诉美国朋友，中共走狗Mother Jones会发布文章攻击我们，果然今天早上就出来了挖苦纳瓦罗参加新中国联邦2周年庆典的文章；我们不求任何人参加爆料革命，但我们希望拯救任何人，尤其是中国同胞
