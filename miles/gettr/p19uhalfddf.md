Alan asks Nicole if any people in the leadership who are more liberal-minded try to use a peaceful transition to overthrow the CCP. Nicole replies that this is exactly what NFSC wants and working towards. We want the revolution to be peaceful, non-threatening, and not harmful to the Chinese people. The Chinese Whistleblowing Movement never used any violence against the dictatorship because we believe that civil disobedience and the awakening of the people is the most powerful way to disintegrate communism.  

Alan 问Nicole是否在中共党内是有思想比较自由的人，用和平的过渡方式来推翻中国共产党。Nicole回答到这正是新中国联邦所希望和努力的方向。因为我们希望革命是和平的，没有威胁的，对中国人民没有伤害的。爆料革命从来没有对独裁政权采取过任何暴力，因为我们相信公民抗命和人民的觉醒是瓦解共产主义的最有力方式。
