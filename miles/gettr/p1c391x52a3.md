The CCP's "Zero-COVID Policy" is a political necessity

On May 29th, Mr. Guo said in his big live-broadcast, the "Zero-COVID Policy" that the Communist Party is playing, is a "bitter meat" to prevent the world from tracing the source of the COVID-19 and to deceive the world with suicidal behaviour. But the parents of the CCP officials do not have to suicide. The "Zero-COVID Policy" is a political necessity, and it is an economic necessity before the economic collapse, also a necessity for the success of the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, but not a necessity for the public.
