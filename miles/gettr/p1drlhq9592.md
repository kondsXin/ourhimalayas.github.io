The European Parliament ‘s plenary adopted the report "The EU and Security Challenges in the Indo-Pacific Region"
On June 9, Mr. Miles Guo blew the whistle that Europe  restricted contacts with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), encouraged the withdrawal of investment and production lines in China, and  supported Taiwan, which could hardly have happened before. The European Parliament ‘s plenary adopted the report "The EU and Security Challenges in the Indo-Pacific Region"  on June 7. It considers Taiwan as a key partner and democratic ally in the Indo-Pacific, urges the EU to strengthen cooperation with Taiwan on diverse issues, and reiterates supporting Taiwan to join international organizations such as  WHO as an observer. The EU's begins to take down the CCP!
