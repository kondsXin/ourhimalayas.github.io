5/13/2022 Miles Guo: If Xi Jinping stays in power after the 20th Party Congress, he will continue messing up China and will end up being buried. If Xi does not stay in power after the 20th Party Congress, Communist China will enter the era of Ceausescu and the post-USSR era. So, there might be no need to wait until 2025. At the end of this year, fellow fighters may pack up and go home and have a cup of tea at Pangu Plaza. I am the only one in the whole who said that the core reason for Russia to lose the Russia-Ukraine war is the loss of talents. But the CCP has lost both talents and money.

5/13/2022 文贵直播：中共20大后如果习不下台，他会继续折腾并终将被埋葬，若习不上台，中共国将进入齐奥塞斯库时代和后苏联时代，所以不用等到2025年，战友们年底就可以打包回家去盘古喝茶！全世界只有文贵才说出，俄罗斯战败的核心原因是人才流失，而中共却人财皆失
