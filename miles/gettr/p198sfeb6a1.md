Putin feared beheading and left the military parade early
On May 10, Mr. Guo Wengui blew the whistle on Gettr that the military parade on Red Square in Russia made the Chinese Communist Party astounded. There were 700,000 to 1.2 million protesters at the scene, and a riot might be launched. Because the sky was monitored and Putin's daughter feared the decapitation action, Putin was allowed to evacuate early.  Putin’s evacuation showed that he was a coward, a political clown and an opportunist! Putin is an incompetent villain who is greedy for life and fears death!

普京担心被斩首阅兵式提前离场
5月10日郭文贵先生在Gettr爆料，俄罗斯红场阅兵让中共傻眼，现场有70万-120万人抗议，可能发动暴乱，天空被定位，普京女儿担心斩首行动，让普京撤离。普京被打回原形，政治小丑，投机主义者！普京是贪生怕死的小人！
