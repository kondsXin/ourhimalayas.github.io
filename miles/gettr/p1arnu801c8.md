5/21/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: Communist China's zero COVID policy shocked the world, and the people around the world can’t understand why the Chinese people could bear it. My experience in the Qingfeng Detention Center indicates that the biggest pain inflicted by the CCP is to let you suffer but you can’t die. What are the evil purposes implied in the CCP’s quote “3 years of hard work after 3 years of hardship. Mess around everything for another 3 years. If that doesn’t work, then do it again for another 10 years”?

5/21/2022 文贵盖特：中共国的清零政策震惊世界，世界却无法理解中国人为何能如此忍受，文贵在清丰看守所的经历说明中共造成的最大痛苦是让你受苦却死不了；中共所谓“苦三年，干三年，折折腾腾又三年，如果不行，就折折腾腾再来十年”的背后有何邪恶目的？
