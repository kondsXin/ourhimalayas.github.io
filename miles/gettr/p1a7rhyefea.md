5/17/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: Europe will initiate a series of major actions towards the Chinese Communist Party which may not be made public though; the U.S. will speed up in purging those U.S. passport holders but work for the CCP; the foreigners now finally understood that the CCP cannot represent the Chinese people and the Chinese people are more miserable than Russians

 5/17/2022 文贵盖特：本周欧洲会对中共会有一系列的大行动，不一定公布啊，美国会加速清洗持美国护照却替共产党卖命的人，外国人已终于明白共产党不能代表中国人，中国人活得还不如俄罗斯人
