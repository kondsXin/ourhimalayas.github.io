5/8/2022 Miles Guo: Once the US imposes sanctions on the CCP, any assets that were traded in the US dollars may be seized. The New Federal State of China can help protect the Chinese people's wealth because we are not involved in any deals with the CCP and we can explain where our wealth comes from. The legalization of digital currencies around the world will initiate the demise of Bitcoin. Not only should our fellow fighters be united, but they should also have a long-term vision and patience.

5/8/2022 文贵直播：美国一旦对中共国开始制裁，中国人用美元交易过的资产都有可能被查封；新中国联邦会保护中国人的财富，因为我们从未和中共打过交道且能说清楚我们财富的来源；全世界数字货币的合法化将开启比特币的灭亡，战友不仅要团结，还要有长远的眼光和耐心
