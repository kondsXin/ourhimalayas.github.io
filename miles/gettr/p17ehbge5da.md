4/27/2022 Holocaust Remembrance Day: Fellow fighter Hua said that mankind should always remember the Holocaust and learn from this tragedy. We put aside hatred and care for each other. When the world is blinded by evil, brave people will unite to stand firmly by their faith and fight for justice. The history that the Israelis became stronger in dire times and built their country with love is an inspiration to the people of the NFSC. The love people have for each other transcends races and nations, for this reason, liberty will prevail and defeat dictatorship.

4/27/2022 犹太人大屠杀纪念日：六月的鲜花战友表示，人类要永远铭记犹太大屠杀并以此为戒，放下仇恨、互相关爱；当世界被邪恶蒙蔽，勇敢的人会团结起来，坚守信仰、维护正义；以色列人在困境中强大、用爱建设国家的历史给新中国联邦人以启发；人类对彼此的关爱超越了种族和国家，正因如此，自由终将得胜独裁
