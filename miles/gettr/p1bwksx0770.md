5/29/2022 Miles Guo: The "zero-COVID policy" is actually the CCP's trick to win others' trust by deliberately hurting itself, and to prevent the world from investigating the origins of the CCP virus. The "zero-COVID policy" is necessary for the CCP's war. It's a necessity for the CCP to prepare for the economic collapse and maintain political stability. It is a necessary condition for the CCP to successfully hold the 20th Party Congress. It only serves the needs of several families of the top CCP officials. No one else would need it.

5/29/2022 文贵直播：共产党在国内的清零政策实际上是苦肉计，让世界不要追溯病毒起源；清零政策是战争的需要，经济崩塌前的需要，政治稳定的需要，20大成功开的需要，只有共产党几个家族需要，没有一个人需要。
