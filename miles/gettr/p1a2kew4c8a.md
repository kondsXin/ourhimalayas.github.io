Actions speak louder than words. As NFSC citizens, the reflections we need to have today are, what we should do, what we have done, and what should we learn and think. They are never being talks all the time, but have no actions to take.

千言万语不如一个行动，今天我们应该思考一下，我们应该做什么，我们曾经做了什么，我们应该学到什么？思考什么？所以我们新中国联邦人，一定要做“行动”的巨人，不做“说话”的矮子。
