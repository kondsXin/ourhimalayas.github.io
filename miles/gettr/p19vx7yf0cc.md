15/05/2022 The real picture of the Chinese Communist Party's rule by falsehoods: fake trees are planted on both sides of the street, and the quotation is expensive. It seems some corrupt officials can enrich themselves again as a result.

5月15日 中国共产党治理下的，以假治国的真实写照：道路两旁栽种假树，且报价昂贵，看来又有不少贪官可以因此而中饱私囊了。
