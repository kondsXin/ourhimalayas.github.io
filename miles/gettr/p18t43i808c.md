5/6/2022 Miles Guo: The Cultural Revolution 2.0 began from the moment when Xi Jinping and Wang Qishan took power; the power-loving Wang Qishan is reduced to attending funerals, etc. as his job, and his life is worse than death; Xi's Three Insistence shows that he will carry out the zero COVID policy to the end and will never change his policy toward the United States; as long as Xi is in power, everything in China will be nationalized, private entrepreneurs will be ruthlessly killed, and the people will be made to accept a life like animals and slaves

5/6/2022 文贵直播：文革2.0版始于习王掌权；酷爱权力的王岐山沦落到只能出席葬礼，生不如死；习的三个坚持说明他会把清零政策进行到底，绝不会改变对美政策；只要习在，中国的一切都会国有化，私人企业家被无情干掉，老百姓被迫接受畜奴生活。
