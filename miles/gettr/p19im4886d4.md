5/12/2022 Miles Guo GETTR: The biggest tragedy of living in Communist China is watching your assets turned into debts and you don’t even have an option to die; The CCP locks your money in the banks, wipes out your money in the stock markets and traps your money in the real estates; the CCP makes you suffer as you live and serve as its obedient slaves!

/12/2022 文贵盖特：生活在中共国的最大悲哀是钱在银行，人去不了天堂；共产党让你的钱锁在银行里、赔在股市里、套在房产里，让你生不如死，老老实实地做它的奴隶！
