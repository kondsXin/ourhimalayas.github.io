【NFSC 2nd Anniversary 】06/04/2022：Japan has made it very clear that they will set up offices of governmental organizations in Taiwan. The U.S. told the CCP clearly that Japan will surely join the UN and become a permanent member, and the UN might be disbanded or restructured. Some U.S. senators are saying the U.S. should consider getting the money they funded the CCP in WWII back. If it happens, the CCP will definitely go bankrupt. 

【新中国联邦2周年】06/04/202：日本明确有机构要进驻台湾，美国明确的告诉中共，日本不仅入常，还会废掉或者重组联合国。美国有议员计划将二战时资助给中共的钱算在账上，这必将导致中共的破产。
