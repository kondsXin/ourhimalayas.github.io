On May 6th Miles Guo pointed out in the live broadcast that the New Federal State of China (NFSC) and the Whistleblow Movement need and gather good people. The standard of good people is honest, brave, kind, and selfless. We should not be eager, selfish and cowardly, and self-centered. People of the NFSC are together in the same boat!

5月6日郭文贵先生直播指出，新中国联邦和爆料革命需要而且聚集好人。好人的标准是诚实、勇敢、善良和无私。战友不要急功近利、自私懦弱和自我中心。新中国联邦人，同舟共济！
