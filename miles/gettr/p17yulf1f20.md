【Ukraine Rescue】04/30/2022 A Polish paramedic volunteer says she is really surprised to see so many Chinese people at the Medyka border. Polish has as well a long history of communism. We understand communism very well, and your situation as well. So, we cross the fingers. Communism has been broken in Europe and it's the future of communism around the world.

【乌克兰救援】04/30/2022  一位来自波兰的医疗救援义工说在梅迪卡看到这么多中国人她真的感到吃惊。波兰也有一段很长时间的共产主义历史，所以我们对共产主义非常了解，对你们的处境感同身受，所以，我们祝愿中国人民好运。共产主义在欧洲已经土崩瓦解，我认为它在全世界也将迎来同样的结局。
