5/10/2022 Miles Guo: Putin received two pieces of intelligence during the Victory Day Parade at the Red Square: 1) there would be a protest by 700,000 to 1.2 million people, which may be turned into a riot, and 2) multiple attempts were made to locate him on site from various directions in the air, making him worry about potential decapitations. Putin failed to see through life and death and is not courageous. He also gets entrapped by sex and money and is not better than any ordinary person. But why would 60-80% of the Chinese women like a foreign man like Putin?

5/10/2022  文贵直播：普京在红场阅兵现场获得了2个情报：(1) 70-120万人要抗议并可能发生暴乱，(2) 天空中有人对普京在现场进行了多方位的定位，他担心被斩首；普京看不透生死、不勇敢，在生殖器和钱上与凡夫俗子无异，为何60%到80%的中国女性喜欢普京这样的外国男人呢？
