Mr. Erez Eshel, founder and President of Ein Prat, Israel's largest organization for training future leaders, former Deputy Director of Israel's Ministry of Education, and founder of the Pre-Military Leadership Institute.
He said: “the book of Obadiah is the book that says, whoever doesn't take a side that stands his side says it's none of his business. He's like the ones that are doing evil. You have to take side. Because when you have the ability, when you see that is good and bad, you mustn't stay neutral.”
Erez Eshel先生是以色利最大的培养未来领袖的组织 Ein Prat的创始人和总裁，曾担任以色列教育部前副主任，军前领袖学院的创始人。他说：俄巴底亚书是这样说的：凡不站在自己一边的，就说这不关他的事。他就像那些作恶的人。你必须要站在一边。因为当你有能力的时候，当你看到好的和坏的，你一定不能保持中立。
