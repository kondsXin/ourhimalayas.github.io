A brave English volunteer joins the Foreign Legion to fight in Ukraine. One of his Ukraine friends has been killed and one has been captured. Nicole tells him that the new Chinese people from the New Federal State of China stand with the Ukrainian people and are taking down the Chinese Communist Party, who is Putin’s friend. He totally agrees and he says “Long live free China! Khay Zhyve Vil’na Ukraini!” May God bless him and protect him, for his safe return.

一名勇敢的英国志愿者加入外国军团去乌克兰参加战斗。一名他的乌克兰朋友被杀害了，另一名朋友被俄军抓获。妮可告诉他新中国联邦的新中国人与乌克兰人民站在一起，并且要推翻中国共产党，他们（中共）是普京的朋友。他完全认同，并说“自由中国万岁！乌克兰万岁！” 愿上帝保佑他、保护他，让他平安归来🙏
