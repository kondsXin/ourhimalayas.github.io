The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) control the circulation of RMB by restricting the bank withdrawals for the deplorable, thus keeping the USD exchange rate to RMB at 6-7. The China’s economy is grossly falsified and fraudulent, and the actual USD exchange rate to RMB is 60-70:1. The CCP manipulates the US dollar exchange right and restricts the exchange amount for the people so that the CCP and the kleptocrats can dominate exchange and loot more than 99% of the wealth created by the people. Without the Chinese Communist Party, there is a new future!

中共限定老百姓银行取钱就可以控制人民币流通，从而保持美元和人民币汇率为6-7。中共经济严重造假，美元兑人民币汇率实际为60-70:1。中共操纵美元兑换权，限制老百姓兑换额度是为共党和盗国贼可以兑换洗劫超过99%的财富。没有共产党，才有新未来！
