4/28/2022 Miles Guo: A fellow fighter who just fled Communist China spoke of how he could tell the intelligence of a person and whether he has a future or not simply through this person’s attitude to the Whistleblowers’ Movement; this fellow fighter’s sister gave up the opportunity of fleeing Shanghai during the lockdown. She totally lost hope in the society and committed suicide; suicide is the worst way of ending one’s life; our compatriots in mainland China, no matter you believe in the Whistleblowers’ Movement or not, please never ever commit suicide!

4/28/2022 文贵直播：一位逃出中共国的战友讲述通过墙内人对爆料革命的态度就可判断其智慧和未来；这位战友的姐姐在上海封城期间放弃了出逃的机会，因对社会彻底失望而自杀；自杀是人生最坏的一条路；国内的同胞们，不管你相信爆料革命与否，千万千万不要自杀！
