【Ukraine Rescue】04/26/2022 Domingos, a volunteer from Mozambique, while praising the relief work of the NFSC, states: What you are expressing is a statement, an opinion and a belief, not in any way a political propaganda. Because of what the evil Chinese Communist Party is doing around the world, people are inevitably prejudiced and discriminated against the Chinese people, so you must stand up for all Chinese people and tell people the difference between you and the Chinese Communist Party and separate the government from the people.  I will stand with you forever. （P1-2)

【乌克兰救援】04/26/2022  多明戈，一位来自莫桑比克的志愿者在赞扬新中国联邦的救援工作之余表示：你们所表达的是一个声明，一种观点和信仰，绝非政治宣传。因为邪恶的中共在世界各地的所为，人们不免会对中国人民产生偏见和歧视，因此，你们必须为所有华人站出来，告诉人们你们和中共的不同，将政府和人民区分开来。我将永远和你们站在一起。（上）
