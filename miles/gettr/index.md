4/10/2022 Miles Guo: In a totalitarian regime, public opinions are easily manipulated by the state propagandas and most people believe what the government tells them. That's why Putin’s internal support rate went up rather than down before the invasion of Ukraine; Now Putin knows that he is losing, and the only way for him to survive is to keep the war going and let more people die.<br/><br/>4/10/2022 文贵直播: 一个国家机器操纵民意的时候，绝大多数老百姓都是相信的，所以战前普京在内部的支持度不降反升；普京知道基本大势已去，要想侥幸得到一线生机，唯有让战争和死亡继续<br/>

4/10/2022 Miles Guo: Now you see the only thing that Xi Jinping is obsessed with is to bring down the dominance of the US dollar. That's the only concern of the CCP. Xi enjoys watching the Chinese people go hungry because of his experience of starvation.<br/><br/>4/10/2022 文贵直播: 习近平非常享受看到中国老百姓挨饿的过程，目前共产党一门心思就是灭掉美元！<br/>

4/13/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: Whether it's the civilians who were raped and killed because Russia invaded Ukraine, or someone in Changchun who used a bag of instant noodles to trade sex with a family, the only way to solve the world's problems is to take down the CCP! After we take down the CCP, communism will no longer exist in the world.<br/><br/>4/13/2022 文贵盖特：不论是俄乌战争被强奸被杀害的平民，还是发生在长春用一袋方便面睡一家子人的荒唐事件，只有灭共才是解决世界问题的唯一办法！中共被我们灭了之后，世界不可能再有共产主义！<br/>

4/13/2022 Miles Guo Live: Our frontline fellow fighter gives details about the Belgium Prime Minister’s visiting the New Federal State of China (NFSC)’s rescue tent in Medyka. The Prime Minister told our fellow fighter Nicole that he was indeed on his way to our NFSC’s tent, and invited Nicole, who was wearing our signature yellow vest, to take a picture with him. Immediately after the Prime Minister’s departure, a NGO from Belgium delivered to our tent many rescue supplies that are in urgent need. Is this a coincidence or a tacit collaboration?<br/><br/>4/13/2022：文贵直播：前线战友讲述昨天比利时总理参观新中国联邦救援帐篷的详细经过. 总理明确告诉Nicole战友他正在去新中国联邦帐篷的路上，并主动邀请穿着黄马甲的Nicole与他一起合影，随即比利时的NGO组织便送来了我们急需的救援物资，这是偶然还是默契？<br/>

4/10/2022 Miles Guo: The time has come for the Chinese Communist Party to begin to “purify” the Chinese. Chinese fellows should be prepared for the worst. The CCP will never hesitate to sacrifice Chinese lives and has prepared in advance for sanctions from Europe and the U.S. The bloody war in Ukraine will escalate into an all-out war between Russia, China and Europe.<br/><br/>4/10/2022 文贵直播: 共产党开始净化中国人的时代已降临！中国同胞要做好最坏的打算。中共不惜牺牲中国人的性命，已提前做好欧美制裁的准备。乌克兰的血腥战争将升级为俄、中、欧的全面战争。<br/>

【Ukraine Rescue】04/12/22 Introducing the interview with the Belgian Prime Minister, Nicole says: Mr. Prime Minister seemed to know who we are and why we are here. He was very receptive to the message of exterminating the Communist Party clearly conveyed on our hat and vest, and was not surprised at all, as if he was very familiar with us, which means that the NFSC has long gained the attention and acquiescence of the international community.<br/><br/>【乌克兰救援】04/12/22 妮可介绍采访比利时首相的经过：首相先生好像知道我们是谁，以及我们为什么在这里，他对我们的帽子和马甲上清楚传达的灭共信息非常接受，一点都不感到惊讶，感觉好像对我们非常熟悉一样。说明新中国联邦早就获得了国际社会的关注与默认。
