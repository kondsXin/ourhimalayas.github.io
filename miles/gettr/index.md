1月6号：连这种乌龟王八的都来解读这个楼来了，只要传说就是好事儿，连这样的真相都没人敢面对……这个民族，这个国家还有救吗？

1/05/2022 Miles Guo: GETTR is a massively disruptive game changer for the entire social media industry. It has broken the monopoly and enslavement of the small interest groups over the people. It is the platform for authentic communications and opinion-sharing between individuals. While other social media are dying, GETTR is thriving, reflecting the influence of the New Federal State of China in the world stage.<br/><br/>1/05/2022 文贵直播：盖特是改变社交媒体游戏规则的game changer（改变者），它打破了集体对个人的垄断和奴役，是人与人交流的真实平台，盖特在其他社交媒体堕落的时候上升，体现了新中国联邦在世界的话语权<br/>

1/05/2022 Miles Guo: Both Nazi Germany and Soviet Union fell after holding Olympics, and all the dictators would make themselves “God” and bring nightmare to the world - the fundamental purpose for Xi to hold the Winter Olympics and to use music to fool the Lao Baixing is to turn himself into “God” so that he can impose a dictatorial rule<br/><br/>1/05/2022 文贵直播：纳粹和苏联都在举办奥运会后灭亡，而独裁者都把自己塑造成神并给世界带来噩梦 - 习办冬奥会和用音乐愚弄老百姓的根本目的都是要把自己当成神从而进行集权统治<br/>

1/05/2022 Miles Guo: The CCP’s real estate has ripped off almost all the Chinese people’s wealth for the next 58 years! The CCP’s control over the real estate is to use Shang Yang’s five strategies to control the future of the Chinese Lao Baixing - rendering them the mortgage slaves, and keeping them barely survive and unable to think so that they can only work desperately to repay the mortgage<br/><br/>1/05/2022 文贵直播：中共房地产把中国人未来58年的韭菜全割完了！中共对房地产的控制就是用商鞅五术来控制老百姓的未来 - 让人们沦为房奴、勉强活着、无法思考，只能拼命打工还房贷<br/>

1/05/2022 Miles Guo: Same with all the dictators in history, Xi Jinping believes that the deaths of the people are inevitable and are necessary for him to make the regime stronger. The Winter Olympics is a gift from God. Because of the Whistleblowers’ Movement, the CCP’s dreams of pushing the digital RMB and invading Taiwan will never come true!<br/><br/>1/05/2022 文贵直播：习太阳和史上所有独裁者一样，它们相信死人是其强大的必须和必然；冬奥会是上天的礼物，有爆料革命在，中共想借奥运强推数字人民币和打台湾的梦想一定不会得逞！<br/>

1/05/2022 Miles Guo: The Communist China’s real estate price will not drop sharply before the downfall of the CCP because real estate is the cornerstone of its rule. Nor will the food price be allowed to rise significantly just in case the Lao Baixing would rebel; the CCP has come up with a 24-month time frame, during which they will issue digital RMB and will plunder the wealth of the Chinese people and the rest of the world<br/><br/>1/05/2022 文贵直播：中共灭亡前房价不会暴跌，因为房地产是其统治的基石，也不会让粮价暴涨以防老百姓造反；中共内定24个月时间表，其间会发行数字人民币，掠夺中国人乃至世界的财富<br/>

1/5/2022 Miles Guo: The CCP is thinking of expanding its territories; the nightmare-like bitter days for the Chinese people will start between May and December this year, more cities will be under lockdown, and more people will be quarantined and disappear; the CCP is using digital RMB to stabilize its estate market and seeks to have a say in terms of digital currency<br/><br/>1/5/2022 文贵直播：中共妄图开疆拓土；中国人噩梦般的苦日子将从今年5月到12月间开始，更多城市会被封，更多人会被隔离和消失；中共用数字货币稳定楼市并想主导数字货币话语权<br/>

Xi’an: a cold-like disease can lead to starvation and the vaccine disaster is unfolding. Only by taking down the CCP can save all the innocent people around the world<br/><br/>西安：一个感冒就要挨饿的地方，疫苗灾难正在发生。只有推翻共产党，才能救这些打了疫苗的全球无辜的人

946,000 people have suffered serious #SideEffects or even died after getting injected with the #COVID #Vaccine. What's worse, not only does the vaccine appear to be useless against the virus, but people who do get injected seem to be much, much worse than those who remain unvaccinated. We are witnessing the serious consequences of this untested, unproven, rushed vaccine firsthand, and it's far worse than anyone feared. This is just the beginning. <br/><br/>94万6千人在注射新冠疫苗后遭受严重副作用，甚至死亡。更糟糕的是，疫苗不仅看起来对病毒无效，而且注射疫苗的人比不注射的人境况更糟。我们正在见证这种未经测试、未经证实、匆忙上市的疫苗的严重后果，它比任何人担心的都更加糟糕。这仅仅是刚刚开始。

1/5/2022 Miles Guo: The President of Lithuania admitted that he was wrong about the Taiwan issue due to Xi blackmailing him with the secrets of his private life; I have been talking about Kazakhstan and Nazarbayev since 2017. That the CCP never exports revolutions is a lie, and the riot is the price paid for Kazakhstan’s collusion with the CCP<br/><br/>1/5/2022 文贵直播：立陶宛总统就台湾问题认错因其把柄被习近平抓住；文贵从2017年就开始谈哈萨克斯坦和纳扎尔巴耶夫，“中共不输出革命”是谎言，哈萨克斯坦的动乱是跟中共为伍的代价

1/05/2021 Miles Guo: Was the riot happening in Kazakhstan provoked by the CIA or part of the CCP’s insidious plan? The President of Kazakhstan will face serious consequences if he refuses to hand over the CCP kleptocrats’ gold to Xi. It’s said that the President has backed down, but as always, the CCP will blame the US for the riot<br/><br/>1/05/2021 文贵直播：哈萨克斯坦暴乱到底是美国CIA挑唆，还是中共使坏？哈总统拒绝返还中共盗国贼的黄金，后果很严重；据说哈总统已服软，但中共这一次照样会甩锅给美国<br/>

1/5/2022 Miles Guo: Nursultan Nazarbayev, Wang Qishan’s best buddy, helped Wang and Jiang Zemin hide 100 tons of gold in Kazakhstan; Xi Jinping had sent Wang Yi to ask Nazarbayev for the gold, and a social unrest occurred right after Wang Yi left Kazakhstan; Nazarbayev threatened Xi that he would establish a diplomatic relationship with Taiwan if Xi demanded gold from him again<br/><br/>1/5/2022 文贵直播：扎尔巴耶夫是王岐山最好的哥们儿，帮王和江藏了100吨黄金在哈萨克斯坦；习近平派王毅找扎尔巴耶夫要黄金，王毅刚走哈萨克斯坦就发生了动乱；纳扎尔巴耶夫竟威胁习，称若习再来要黄金就和台湾建交<br/>

💓💓MORE THAN HALF A MILLION NOW - This was published on January 4, 2021 - - - Huge: Half million follow Joe Rogan to GETTR💓💓<br/><br/>"GETTR, an upstart Twitter challenger aimed at free speech advocates and conservatives who have been squelched on liberal-leaning social media sites, is nearing four million users exactly six months after its Independence Day launch.<br/><br/> The site reported that Rogan’s announcement prompted more than 171,000 people to open GETTR accounts Sunday. On Monday, another 341,000 joined, and as of today, new sign-ups have totaled 545,000 since Rogan said, “Just in case s*** over at Twitter gets even dumber, I’m here now as well.

The new episode of @plugtalkshow is now live featuring the ridiculously hot @emilywillisxoxo 😳 this is actually the first episode we ever shot. We interviewed her and then we ate her ass together. It was beautiful. Link in my bio
