1/18/2021 Miles Guo’s GETTR: How powerful Weijian Shan and Edward Moss really are? In the past five years, why is it that the CCP’s unrestricted lawfare, the smear campaigns, and the attacks on me and the Whistleblowers’ Movement all happened at roughly the same time? Are these just coincidences?<br/><br/>1/18/2021 文贵盖特：单伟建和Edward Moss到底有多大的能耐？过去5年里，为什么中共对文贵和爆料革命的法律超限战以及污蔑与攻击几乎都在同时发生？难道这仅仅是巧合吗？<br/>

1/17/2022 Miles Guo: The lives, blood, freedom, and wealth sacrificed by my family led to my awakening, allowing me to lead all humanity to begin taking down the CCP! In a country ravaged by the CCP without the rule of law, what a blessing it is to destroy the CCP!<br/><br/>1/17/2022 文贵直播：文贵以家人的命、鲜血、自由和财富换来个人的觉醒，让文贵今天带着全人类开始灭共！在这个被共产党蹂躏和没有法律的国度里，灭共是件多么幸福的事！<br/>

1/17/2022 Miles Guo: What's the story behind the photo I took with my younger brother when I was 7 years old? What did I look like when I was a child? What kind of life did I have as a child in Northeast China back then?<br/><br/>1/17/2022 文贵直播：文贵7岁时跟八弟拍的照片背后有什么有趣的故事？文贵小时候是什么样子的？在当年在东北过着怎样的童年生活？<br/>

1/17/2022 Miles Guo: My upbringing shows how terrible the CCP’s evilness is! The CCP’s murder of my younger brother woke me up early, so from a young age I began to understand the evil of the CCP, and the first thing I seek to eradicate is everything of the CCP!<br/><br/>1/17/2022 文贵直播：文贵的成长经历就说明了共产党的邪恶有多么可怕！中共杀害八弟让文贵很早就觉醒，于是从小便开始了解中共的恶，而文贵第一个要铲除的就是共产党的一切！<br/>

1/17/2022 Miles Guo: The CCP’s frivolous lawsuits keep pushing us step by step. I predict that the ruling will go against us when the Lady May case goes on trial on February 2nd. The CCP has controlled the entire judicial system in BVI, and Appleby, the law firm representing the opposing party, also has conflicts of interest. Our second battlefield is right in BVI!<br/><br/>1/17/2022 文贵直播：中共缠诉步步紧逼，文贵预测2月2日Lady May的案子开庭将被判大输；BVI的司法体系被共产党搞定，对方的Appleby律所竟也有利益冲突，我们的第二战场就在BVI！<br/>

`@miles 1/18/2022 10:57 PM (UTC)`

1/17/2022 Miles Guo: What will happen in the hearing to be held on February 2nd? Why is the Pacific Alliance case comparable to the case of Li You tried by Zhang Mingpeng in Xigang District, Dalian? Why did the Pacific Alliance issue subpoenas for the very information that the CCP wants the most? Is there any collusion between Bruno Wu, Wang Qishan, and the law firms that have offices in Communist China? What is the connection between those who were involved in the largest corruption case in the DOJ history and the Pacific Alliance case?<br/><br/>1/17/2022 文贵直播：2月2日的听证会将发生什么？为何说太平联盟案跟大连西岗区张明鹏判的李友案有的一比？太平联盟发传票要求提供的信息为何恰恰是中共最想要的？吴征、王岐山和在中共国设办公室的律所之间有何勾当？美国司法部史上最大腐败案的涉案人员和太平联盟案有何关联？<br/>

1/17/2022 Miles Guo: Can the Pacific Alliance case represent procedural justice? This lawsuit should not have existed in the first place, and Judge Barry Ostrager had long been turning a blind eye to Bradley Bondi and Edward Moss's clear breach of the lawyers’ professional ethics. The two lawyers not only committed forgery, but their mere conflict of interest nearly devastated us. So, who will make up for the damage they have inflicted on us in the past five years?<br/><br/>1/17/2022 文贵直播：处处不正常的太平联盟案能代表程序正义吗？这场官司本不应该存在，可Ostrager法官却长期无视Bondi和Edward Moss明显违反律师道德的行为，他们俩不仅造假，区区一次利益冲突就差点要了咱的命，那谁来弥补他们在这5年给我们造成的伤害呢？<br/><br/>

1月18号：尊敬的战友们好，感谢很多战友为我和b八弟修复照片和制作的视频，万分的感谢！🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏共产党的内部政治斗争和冬奥会的残局……将会带来什么？太平联盟的官司五年来一直和共产党攻击爆料革命的偶然行动：同步进行，这个背后的故事到底是什么？明天直播我们好好聊聊，一切都已经开始！

1/17/2022 Miles Guo: The judge in the Pacific Alliance case did not allow us to choose jury trial and gave a huge fine to Lady May, which is not even owned by myself, and the adverse party provided more than 70,000 pages of evidence and over 300,000 pages of documents to overwhelm us, turning the lawsuit about the $30-million loan into the one costing hundreds of millions of dollars in legal fees. The Pacific Alliance admitted that the principal and interest of the loan were paid off, but why did the Beijing police want to assist them to deal with this case?<br/><br/>1/17/2022 文贵直播：太平联盟案的法官不许我们选陪审团审判、给并非文贵所有的Lady May开巨额罚单，对方提供7万多页的证据和30余万页的文件，3000万的官司却要花费上亿律师费；太平联盟承认借款的本息均已还清，但北京警察为何要协助他们处理本案呢？<br/>

1/17/2022 Miles Guo: This Pacific Alliance case is so ridiculous! Pacific Alliance sued me, the loan guarantor, out of nothing despite there being legal documents proving that the borrower had repaid the loan. A New York court accepted this case regardless of the fact that the plaintiff is not in New York and neither did the whole thing happen in New York. The defendant was not allowed to challenge the verdict, and they seek to seize the property that does not belong to the defendant<br/><br/>1/17/2022 文贵直播: 太平联盟一案荒谬至极！太平联盟在有法律文件证明借方已还清贷款的情况下却无中生有起诉贷款担保人，而纽约法院受理了一个当事人和事件都不在纽约的案件，而且既不允许被告对判决提出任何质疑，又要查封不属于被告的财产！<br/>

`@miles 1/18/2022 4:28 AM (UTC)`

1/17/2021 Miles Guo: The largest corruption case in the DOJ history reflects the CCP spies’ infiltration in the Western judicial system. Pacific Alliance hired a former FBI official bought off by Bruno Wu as the investigative attorney and even used fake evidence about GTV fabricated by Duowei News, which belongs to the CCP’s intelligence agency network<br/><br/>1/17/2021 文贵直播：美国司法部史上最大的腐败案反映了中共间谍对西方司法的渗透；太平联盟雇了被吴征收买的前FBI官员做调查律师，并使用中共情报网站多维捏造的关于GTV的假证据<br/>

`@miles 1/18/2022 3:43 AM (UTC)`

1/17/2022 Miles Guo: The lawsuit between Pacific Alliance and me is a life and death fight between the CCP and me - the CCP filed the lawsuit against me one day before VOA cut my broadcast on April 19, 2017, and the CCP sent Liu Yanping and Sun Lijun to threaten me not to blow the whistle. What is the relationship between Pacific Alliance and Bruno Wu? How do the law firm where Edward Moss worked previously and the judge in the Pacific Alliance case have to do with the CCP?<br/><br/>1/17/2022 文贵直播：太平联盟案就是文贵与中共的生死之战 - 中共在VOA 419断播前一天便发起诉讼并先后派出刘彦平和孙力军威胁文贵；太平联盟和吴征有何关系？Edward Moss之前的律所和太平联盟案的法官与中共有何关联？<br/>

1/17/2022 Miles Guo: I am fighting the world's biggest lawsuit manipulated by the CCP! Bradley J. Bondi, who had represented me and our fellow fighters before, had Edward Moss, who is representing Pacific Alliance, join Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP to work together against me. Both of them were disqualified as the plaintiff’s counsel due to their serious violations of professional ethics.<br/><br/>1/17/2022 文贵直播：文贵在跟中共操纵的世界大案较量！曾代理文贵和战友的Bondi律师让太平联盟的律师Edward Moss跳槽到Cahill律所并一同针对文贵，他俩因判严重违反职业道德而被踢出局<br/>

马龙博士：《真相工程》曝光国防部文件内容绝对真实，是体制内对病毒来源真相爆料的启动！国防部终于出来说“够了”，并把托尼·福奇抛出！<br/><br/>Dr. Malone:  The Veritas exposure of DoD file is the start of apparatus whistleblowers and absolutely authentic. DoD finally coming around saying: enough is enough and throwing Tony Fauci under the bus!<br/>

1/17/2022 Miles Guo: Miles Guo’s outlook on the Pacific Alliance case - we must use procedural justice to reveal the truths to the world through real evidence. Finally, the Department of Justice, Congress, and others will be fully involved in the investigations. The outcome of the PAX case will lead to the global efforts to take down the CCP, completely removing the toxins buried deep in the US and Europe by the CCP.<br/><br/>1/17/2022 文贵直播：文贵先生对太平联盟案的展望，我们一定要用程序正义、真实的证据让真相大白于天下，最终美国司法部、国会等会全面介入调查，太平联盟案件的结果会带动全球灭共，把共产党深藏在美国欧洲的毒刺彻底拔除

1/17/2022 Miles Guo: Darkness coming to the world is manifested in the CCP’s manipulation of the media, plunder of the people’s wealth, and control of the judicial system. We must take down the CCP with the law and let the Chinese people have an independent judicial system. If you didn’t fight for it, you would be the next one persecuted by the CCP like me.<br/><br/>1/17/2022 文贵直播：黑暗降临世界体现在中共操纵媒体、洗劫民众财富和控制司法系统；我们要以法灭共，让中国人有独立的司法系统；如果不为之奋斗，大家也会像七哥一样被中共迫害！<br/>

1/17/2022 Miles Guo: Looking back at the 2017 case of Pacific Alliance v. Miles Guo, why did Boxun and Xiong Xianmin know the verdict before the judge ruled? Why were the legal fees for Boxun and all the frivolous lawsuits against Miles Guo paid by Bruno Wu, a partner of PAG? Is it normal to have so many "coincidences"?<br/><br/>1/17/2022 文贵直播：回看2017年太盟诉文贵先生案，为什么博讯、熊宪民在法官判决前就能知道判决结果？为什么博讯和所有与文贵先生有关的法律缠诉案的律师费是吴征提供的，而吴征和太盟是合伙人关系？如此多的“偶然”正常吗？<br/>

Dr. Geert Vanden Bossche (Virologist-Vaccinologist):<br/>The mass vaccinations are generating a breeding ground for even more infectious variants to replicate and the CCP virus will escape. If the COVID vaccines cannot prevent the transmission, this pandemic cannot be controlled. Vaccinations will be at risk of inducing autoimmune responses, autoimmunity in children. So under no single circumstance should you allow to get your child vaccinated.<br/><br/>Geert Vanden Bossche 博士，病毒学家-疫苗学家：这种大规模的新冠疫苗接种正为更具传染性病毒变种的复制制造温床，中共病毒将逃逸。如果新冠疫苗不能防止传播，就不能控制这种大流行病。接种新冠疫苗有诱发儿童自身免疫反应的风险。在任何情况下，你都不应该允许自己的孩子接种新冠疫苗。
