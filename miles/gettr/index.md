2/9/2022 Miles Guo: The UBS case will unearth $50 trillion that the CCP has hidden overseas, which will allow the Chinese people to receive free education, health care, and funeral services and will eliminate all mortgage and credit card debts. The CCP sent people to lure me with money to settle with UBS, but they failed.<br/><br/>2/9/2022 文贵直播：UBS案将挖出中共在海外藏的50万亿美元，这笔钱能让中国人获得免费教育、医疗和丧葬并将免除所有的房贷和信用卡欠款；中共派人以金钱诱惑文贵跟UBS和解未果<br/>

2/9/2022 Miles Guo: Why do I keep fighting against PAG and UBS in court? Not for money, but to expose the truths about Weijian Shan and Bo Shan as well as the collusion between UBS and the CCP. That our lawsuit against UBS was accepted in the UK means the judge has recognized that our claims have a factual basis.<br/><br/>2/9/2022 文贵直播：为何要跟PAG和UBS打官司？不是为了钱，而是揭露单伟建和单博的真面目并曝光UBS和中共的勾兑；UBS官司在英国被受理说明法官承认我们的索赔有事实依据<br/>

2/9/2022 Miles Guo: To recover the wealth, dignity, and justice that the Chinese people have lost in the past 70 years, I will make myself a person that owns nothing and will move to London to fight UBS in court. After that, I will go to Japan to fight against the CCP at close range and will let the people across Communist China hear my voice directly.<br/><br/>2/9/2022 文贵直播：为找回中国人70年来失去的财富、尊严和公正，文贵将让自己变得一无所有，到伦敦跟UBS打官司，再到日本与中共短兵相接，让中共国每个角落都将直接听到七哥的声音<br/>

2/9/2022 Miles Guo: Three major events today - 1) I have started to openly fight the swamp in court for the first time; 2) I will go to the UK and Japan to fight the CCP at close range; 3) I will prepare for the worst in case of the CCP's threats. We will wage a full-scale war on the PAG case and will thoroughly expose the CCP’s BGY scheme and infiltration against the West<br/><br/>2/9/2022 文贵直播：今天的三件大事 - 1) 首次在法庭上跟沼泽地公开较量; 2) 文贵将去英国与日本与中共短兵相接；3) 面对中共的威胁，文贵将做好一切最坏准备；我们将对PAG案全面开战并彻底揭露中共对西方的蓝金黄和渗透<br/>

`@miles 2/9/2022 10:48 PM (UTC)`

2/9/2022 Miles Guo: The case of  Weijian Shan and PAG reveals the dark secrets of the Chinese Communist Party's deep penetration of the U.S. barristers and the judiciary, and the case filing of UBS in the British court opens the door to the evil collusion between the swamp and the CCP<br/><br/>2/9/2022 文贵直播：单伟建和PAG案揭露了中共深度渗透美国大律师界和司法界的黑幕，瑞银(UBS)在英国法院立案是打开了沼泽地和中共邪恶勾兑的大门

2/9/2022 Miles Guo: Why am I entering into a new stage of my life today? The money deposited in UBS, including its hidden accounting records, is equivalent to the wealth accumulated by mankind in the past 500 years. Yesterday, many big shots thought it was impossible for my lawsuit against UBS to be filed in a London court.<br/><br/>2/9/2022 文贵直播：为什么说七哥在今天进入了人生新高度？瑞银UBS的存款和黑账相当于人类过去500年的财富，UBS案能在伦敦法院立案，这在昨天都是很多大咖认为不可能的事情<br/>

2/9/2022 Miles Guo: Finally, my lawsuit against UBS has been filed in London after having gone through the CCP's relentless obstruction at all costs. This is of great significance! It is our first official battle against the Swamp. Defeating UBS is equivalent to taking over half of the CCP’s “wealth empire”.<br/><br/>2/9/2022 文贵直播：UBS案历经了中共不惜一切代价的阻挠，今天终于在伦敦法院立上案了，意义重大啊！这是和沼泽地的第一场正式的战役，干掉UBS就相当于拿下了中共的半个“财富帝国”<br/>

2月8号：尊敬的战友们好！今天早上发出盖特以后，很多战友关心是我要公布什么事？七哥要公布是很小很小的个人事儿，只是和我个人有关……和其他没有关系，请大家不要多想，谢谢！

2月8号：尊敬的战友们好，你们健身了吗？传播C C P病毒．疫苗解药的真相了吗？今天可能将是我文贵人生的前半生和后半生的分水岭的一天．今天我将有个很大的决定，明天直播时再向大家汇报，一切都已经开始！

2/6/2022 Miles Guo: The current economic situation in the US indicates that the CCP virus and the COVID vaccine disasters have destroyed the supply chains. I have said in early 2020 that the secondary disasters and crises caused by the CCP virus and COVID vaccines will start this May. This is the conclusion I draw based upon the intelligence I have about the CCP.<br/><br/>2/6/2022 文贵直播：美国目前的经济说明中共病毒和疫苗灾难摧毁了供应链；文贵在2020年初就说病毒和疫苗造成的次生灾难和危机将于今年5月开始，这是文贵基于所掌握的中共情报而作出的判断<br/>

2/6/2022 Miles Guo: Why did the CCP let Weijian Shan go abroad during the Cultural Revolution? How did the CCP infiltrate the US by using the Ping-pong diplomacy?<br/>China and the US depend on each other for security and complement each other in terms of culture, and there is no historical conflict between the two. The Sino-US economic cooperation will be the best in the world!<br/><br/>2/6/2022 文贵直播: 中共为什么在文革期间让单伟建出国？中共是如何用乒乓外交渗透美国的？中美之间生死与共、文化互补、无历史冲突，中美经济合作必将是天下第一！<br/>

2/6/2022 Miles Guo: Our fellow fighters are everywhere at the Winter Olympics such that I can always know what is going on. Fellow fighters have helped foreign leaders and athletes understand the true nature of the CCP, and this is the fundamental reason why Putin left Communist China earlier than expected.<br/><br/>2/6/2022 文贵直播: 冬奥会无处不在的战友让现场的一切情况尽在文贵的掌握之中；新中国联邦的战友们在冬奥会让外国元首和运动员认清中共本质，这就是普京提前离开中共国的根本原因<br/>

2月7号：尊敬的战友们好你们健身了吗？几天来，中国绑架妇女的事件……强烈的震撼了我……让我感到自责．后悔．为是那个地方的人．感到极为的可耻，我们必须消灭共产党，拯救同胞拯救人类．行动．行动．行动！

Ms. Christine Anderson said, "Whenever a political entity resorts to extortion and manipulation to push an agenda so hard, you can almost always be sure your benefit is definitely not what they had at heart. I will not be vaccinated with anything that has not been properly vetted and tested, and has shown no sound scientific evidence that the benefits outweigh the risks and that there are no long-term side effects. I will not get vaccinated because my government tells me to and promises in return I will be granted freedom. No one grants me freedom, for I am a free person."<br/><br/>欧盟议会议员 Christine Anderson 女士：每当一个政治团体如此强硬地推行他们的计划，并且为了达到目的而使用威逼利诱的手段时，你几乎可以肯定，他们的心里绝对没有你的利益。我不会注射任何没有经过适当审查和测试、没有可靠科学证据能够表明其利大于弊且不会有长期副作用的疫苗。我也绝对不会为了政府许诺给我的自由而去打疫苗。没有人可以给我自由，因为我本就是一个自由人。

2/6/2022 Miles Guo: The reason why the CCP kowtows to Russia is that the Caucasians in the West don’t want to engage with them. So, the CCP can only use the excuse that Russia is the origin of communism to fool the Chinese people. With the anger building up in the hearts of the Chinese, they can turn against the CCP once they have a chance.<br/><br/>2/6/2022 文贵直播: 中共认俄爹是因为西方白人不愿和中共交往，中共只好以俄国是共产主义发源地为由忽悠中国人；中国老百姓心中积压的怒火使得他们一有机会就会向中共动手<br/>

2/6/2022 Miles Guo: The CCP collects urine and feces from the leaders and athletes of various countries participating in the Winter Olympics to serve its evil purpose - to extract and use their genes to produce a “better” race. The CCP is racist at its core and worships superior physiques and eugenics.<br/><br/>2/6/2022 文贵直播: 中共收集参加冬奥会各国领导人和运动员的尿和大便是服务于其邪恶的目的 - 提取并用他们的基因以生出“更优秀”的种族；中共骨子里是种族主义者并且崇拜优秀人体和基因<br/>

2/6/2022 Miles Guo: The Winter Olympics is dedicated to Xi Jinping only! Everyone in the CCP hates Xi for holding the Winter Olympics and the athletes colluding with the CCP. The CCP lacks both the financial resources and capabilities to successfully host the Winter Olympics. The West started to investigate the corruption in the International Olympics Committee caused by the CCP.<br/><br/>2/6/2022 文贵直播: 冬奥会是习太阳一个人的！党内都恨习办冬奥会以及和中共同流合污的运动员；中共在财力和能力上都无法保证冬奥会成功召开；西方已开始调查国际奥委会跟中共的腐败<br/>

2/6/2022 Miles Guo: The CCP got a slap in the face by claiming that more than 100 countries would participate in the opening of the Winter Olympics, while in fact less than five leaders of powerful countries made it. The opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics has become the closing ceremony of the end of the CCP. Putin's girlfriend brought her own rations when visiting Communist China and has never had the food offered by the CCP because it contains chemicals.<br/><br/>2/6/2022 文贵直播：中共被打脸，号称百余国参加的冬奥会开幕却只有不到5个有实力国家的元首出席；冬奥会开幕式已成为中共结束的闭幕式；普京女友访华自带口粮，从不碰中共化学食品<br/>
![img](https://media.gettr.com/group3/getter/2022/02/07/05/35aa86ea-6265-0d55-ec66-2e5d5b0df84c/out.jpg)

2/6/2022 Miles Guo: The all-weather strategic partnership is essentially forming alliances. Money is the key for the CCP to maintain its relationship with Russia. Although Russia’s annual GDP is only $1 trillion, it signed gas agreements with the CCP with a total deal value of over $1 trillion. Why did Putin go back to Russia without signing the deal with the CCP to designate the RMB as Russia’s legal tender?<br/><br/>2/6/2022 文贵直播：中共全天候战略伙伴的本质是结盟；维持中俄关系全靠钱，只有1万亿美元GDP的俄罗斯从中共就签了总价值1万多亿的合同；普京为何不跟中共签把人民币作为法币的协议就回去了呢？<br/>
