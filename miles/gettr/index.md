3/13/2022 Miles Guo: The CCP's boast of having stockpiled two and a half years of grain reserve is a total lie!

The war pianist just moved the piano right next to the tents provided by the ROL Foundation and the NFSC. He started the outdoor concert tonight with John Lennon’s classic song “Imagine”.

在战火纷飞的乌克兰，只有我们新中国联邦人，不畏危险来到前线，不求任何回报，不带任何条件，向受难的所有同胞伸出援助之手。新中国联邦将让中国人找回浪漫、尊严、善良、和平、友好，让中国人成为世界上最受尊敬、最爱打交道的人，而不是共产党在全世界塑造的虚假、懦弱、自私的样子！ <br/>In the midst of the war in Ukraine, only we, the citizens of the New Federal State of China (NFSC), have been on the frontline of rescue despite the danger, all in order to extend a helping hand to our stranded compatriots, unconditionally and without expecting anything in return. <br/>The NFSC has enabled the Chinese people to recapture a sense of romance, dignity, kindness, peace and friendliness, making them the most respected and pleasant people to interact with, as opposed to the image of deceptiveness, cowardice and selfishness that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has portrayed throughout the world.
