1/12/2022 Miles Guo: The Zhu Rongji family and the Jiang Zemin family have made a huge sum of money by giving large portions of China’s territories to Tajikistan and Afghanistan in exchange for the permanent ownership of the mining rights in that area. This is what treason is! The so-called Hetian Jade turned out not to be produced from Hetian, Xinjiang, but from Russia<br/><br/>1/12/2022 文贵直播：朱镕基、江泽民家族把中国大片领土给了塔吉克斯坦和富汗，以换取当地矿产的永久开发权从而攫取大量财富，这就叫卖国！所谓和田玉并竟非和田产，却产自俄罗斯<br/>

1/12/2022 Miles Guo: Ray Dalio and Wang Qishan have a very close relationship, and he has inflicted a tremendous amount of harm on the Chinese people. Ray Dalio is bound to be prosecuted in the US courts! The “common prosperity” pushed by the global elites who are in cahoots with the CCP, such as Ray Dalio, is in fact communism!<br/><br/>1/12/2022 文贵直播：雷·达利奥是王岐山的生死兄弟，他对中国人造成了极大的伤害，他必将受到美国的审判！雷·达利奥等全球精英跟中共沆瀣一气在全球推行的“共享财富”就是共产主义！<br/>

1/12/2022 Miles Guo: What are the six key characteristics that define a cult? The CCP slanders the Whistleblowers’ Movement and the New Federal State of China as a cult by using Isobel Yeung, while in fact the CCP meets all the criteria for a cult - the CCP is indeed a cult! We will keep fighting against Isobel Yeung and HBO/VICE to the end!<br/><br/>1/12/2022 文贵直播：邪教有哪6大特征？中共通过杨贝贝污蔑爆料革命和新中国联邦是邪教，殊不知中共却符合每一条邪教的典型特征 - 中共就是邪教！我们要跟杨贝贝和HBO/VICE干到底！<br/>

On 10th December last year Miles Guo first talked about Yang Jiechi has arrested over a dozen fellow fighters who are Cypriot passport holders; New Federal State of China will rescue them at all cost; fellow fighters must leave Cyprus immediately if possible, and Dubai is not safe either; fellow fighters in Canada must watch out for the CCP spies lurking in our Whistleblowers’ Movement!<br/><br/>在去年12月10日的直播中文贵第一次提到杨洁篪抓了拿塞浦路斯护照的十几位战友，新中国联邦将全力营救他们；请能离开塞浦路斯的战友马上走，迪拜也不安全；请加拿大的战友务必小心中共潜伏的特务！<br/>

1/12/2022 Miles Guo: The CCP is provoking anti-Chinese sentiment around the world. In Japan, a person called a fellow fighter’s name in his car, and another fellow fighter was fired by the restaurant for no reason. The schools in Europe and the US are even discriminating against the Asian students as a whole. Without the efforts of the Whistleblowers’ Movement, the anti-Chinese tragedies will spread like wildfire across the globe!<br/><br/>1/12/2022 文贵直播：中共在全球制造排华，在日本的战友在车上被骂，还有战友被餐厅无故解雇，欧美院校排斥全体亚裔学生；假如没有爆料革命，排华的惨剧将如野火一样蔓延在全世界！<br/>

1/12/2022 Miles Guo: Why did Isobel Yeung happen to be there to specifically interview the Chinese people on January 6, 2021? Why is it the case that she is executing a conspiracy that has been brewing for years? Fellow fighters’ personal experiences show that discrimination against the Chinese is everywhere, and there will be tens of millions of anti-Chinese incidents in the future!<br/><br/>1/12/2022 文贵直播：杨贝贝为什么能恰好在2021年1月6日去专门采访华人？为什么说她执行的是酝酿多年的阴谋？战友的亲身经历说明对华人的歧视无处不在，未来的排华事件将以千万计！

德约科维奇的母亲支持儿子：如果诺瓦克是健康的，他不应该为了参赛而被逼着接种疫苗。疫苗是个人选择，是人权。打了两针甚至三针疫苗的人也感染了病毒。说诺瓦克不接种疫苗，如果他在球场上咳嗽，可能会感染上万人，这种说法很愚蠢。<br/><br/>Djokovic’s mother backing up her son: If Novak is healthy, he should not be pressured to take the vaccine in order to play tennis. Vaccine is a personal choice, it is human rights. People who vaccinated with 2 shots even 3 shots are infected with coronavirus as well. The notion that if Novak is not vaccinated, he might get 10,000 people sick if he coughs on the court is silly. <br/><br/>

1/12/2022 Miles Guo: All dictators create conflicts and hatred. Now the CCP is keeping the Chinese people at home by using the virus, and then they will take away their wealth in the name of “common prosperity”. The CCP and their running dogs in the West are also going to push the agenda of “common prosperity”, and the Chinese diasporas will be the targets, with their wealth to be taken away!<br/><br/>1/12/2022 文贵直播：独裁者都会制造矛盾和仇恨，现在中共是通过病毒把老百姓关在家，然后来共享他们的财富；中共及其走狗在西方也要搞共享财富，海外华人将成为被共享财富的对象！<br/>

1/12/2022 Miles Guo: Under the pretense of locking down the cities, the CCP is pushing the “common prosperity” movement, seeking to take away the wealth of the 120 and 200 enterprises in Xi’an and Tianjin, respectively. The “common prosperity” movement has already begun in Zhengzhou, and it will take place in Zhejiang and Jiangsu soon.<br/><br/>1/12/2022 文贵直播：中共假借封城之机搞“共享财富”，妄图在西安和天津分别夺走120家和200家企业的财富，郑州也已经开始，接下来会轮到江浙！<br/>

1/12/2022 Miles Guo: The fundamental purpose for the CCP to implement the “zero-COVID” policy in Xi’an, Tianjin, and Zhengzhou is to lock the people up in their homes so that the CCP can tighten their grip on the Chinese people and legitimately kill them with the virus, and such practices will be implemented in the rest of Communist China as well. The CCP’s gathering people to do nucleic acid testing together has greatly increased the spread of the virus.<br/><br/>1/12/2022 文贵直播：中共在西安、天津和郑州搞清零政策的根本目的是把人民关在家以对其实施严格管控并合法用病毒杀人，这种模式将推广至全国；中共搞集中检测大大加剧了病毒的传播<br/>

The authorities of Cyprus have found themselves in the middle of a serious, but also complicated case with political implications<br/><br/>The whole case, however, is complicated by other relevant facts and events. The two detainees are members and political activists of the New Federal State of China. This political movement, also known as the lobby, was created by Guo Wengui and Steve Bannon, with the stated aim of overthrowing the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and consequently the Chinese government.<br/><br/>Founded on June 4, 2020 in New York, it calls itself the “exiled government” of China and is indirectly recognized by the United States.<br/><br/>https://gnews.org/1851956/

塞浦路斯当局发现自己陷入了一个严重但也具有政治影响的复杂案件之中<br/><br/>整个案件因其他相关事实和事件而变得复杂。这两名被拘留者是新中国联邦的成员和政治活动家。这场政治运动，也称为游说，由郭文贵和史蒂夫·班农发起，其既定目标是推翻中国共产党（CCP），进而推翻中国政府。<br/><br/>它于2020年6月4日在纽约成立，自称是中国的“流亡政府”，间接得到美国的承认。<br/><br/><br/><br/>https://gnews.org/zh-hans/1851946/<br/>

Ray Dalio, an old friend of the Chinese Communist Party and founder of the Bridgewater Associate, has endorsed the Communist Party's "Common Prosperity" and urged countries, including the United States, to narrow the gap between the rich and the poor. Miles Guo has already warned the West on one of his live stream about the deceptive nature of the CCP's "Common Prosperity"policy. "Common Prosperity" is actually “the era of Communism” renamed as "the era of Common Prosperity". Hong Kong is the first example of what "Common Prosperity" entails. Once again, Mr. Guo's accurate grasp of Chinese Communist intelligence has been verified.<br/><br/>中共的老朋友桥水基金创始人雷·达里奥为中共的“共同富裕”背书，并敦促包括美国在内的国家缩小贫富差距。郭先生早前已在直播中警告西方，中共“共同富裕”政策的欺骗本质，实则是共产主义的时代换名为“共同富裕的时代”，香港就是其第一个例子。再次验证郭先生对中共情报的准确掌握。

The content of Wang Yi's call with the Kazakh foreign minister  on 10th Jan verified  Miles Guo‘s source again that China and Kazakhstan have, as Miles Guo pointed out live on 5th of Jan accused the US-led Western forces of causing the riots.<br/><br/>1月10日王毅同哈外长通话内容再次验证文贵的准确情报，中哈已经一如文贵先生1月5日直播中指出的那样，将动乱甩锅以美国为首的西方势力

中共病毒❗️CCP virus❗️<br/>中国人民和加拿大人民都是受害者❗️<br/>中共不代表中国人‼️<br/><br/>加拿大蒙特利尔一名女子，日前在超市辱骂一对加拿大华裔夫妇，称新冠疫情“是因为你们中国人”。<br/>她其后被警察带走。<br/>蒙特利尔市市长此事表示“震惊且不可接受”，并谴责其涉种族歧视言论。

盖特CEO的每句话都令人振奋！中文字幕用的是黄色，但是只有一处用了蓝色。英喜视频组的战友太有心了！棒极了！棒极了👍👍👍
> `@himalayahawk777 1/10/2022 1:59 AM (UTC)`<br/>Jason Miller:<br/>下个月，我们将推出我们自己的竞争者。称之为 #Vision，这是一种短视频格式，与Instagram Reels竞争，也与 #抖音 竞争，因为短视频概念真正推动社交媒体的参与度，今年年中，我们将推出 #盖特支付，这是一个类似于苹果支付或支付宝的在线支付平台<br/><br/>We're going to call it #Vision, which will be a short video format, competes with Instagram Reels, but then also with TikTok, because we know that the short video concept is that's really what drives a lot of engagement on social media.<br/>Coming up in the middle of the year, we're going to launch a #GetterPay, which, yes, will be a payment platform online payment platform similar to an Apple Pay or an AlliPay
