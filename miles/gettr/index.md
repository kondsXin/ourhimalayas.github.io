<br/>【419 5th Anniversary】 4/19/2022 April 19, 2017, was absolutely the real beginning of the Whistleblowers’ Movement. We have proved over the five years that we respect women and love our mothers. 70% of the fellow fighters of the Whistleblowers’ Movement are females, who have set a new image of the females of the new China in the world and will be the most wealthy, the most powerful, and the most influential. The past five years are the most spectacular years that we have spent together with all the conscientious Chinese.<br/><br/>【419五周年】4/19/2022 419是爆料革命真正的开始！5年来，证明了我们尊敬女性、爱自己的母亲；女性占爆料革命战友的七成，在全世界树立了新中国女性的新形象，她们将成为最有钱、权力和影响力的人；过去的5年是我们和中国有良知的人度过的最最伟大的5年！<br/>

4/19/2022 【419 5th Anniversary】 Most of those who were tested positive for COVID-19 in Shanghai were due to the adverse reactions to the COVID vaccines. A Fellow fighter, an insider of the CCP’s system, revealed the CCP had gone so insane that it would implement a massive lockdown and test the limits of what people can tolerate. And the CCP would also take the opportunity to get rid of some older adults. Just having food and water is not enough to get through it.<br/><br/>4/19/2022【419五周年】上海绝大多数人核酸检测呈阳性是疫苗反应造成的。体制内战友爆料，中共正在丧心病狂地准备在北京进行大隔离、搞极限测试，并趁机除掉一些老年人，这可不光是有粮食有水就行的！<br/>

4/19/2022 【419 5th Anniversary】 According to the latest data, the number of total followers of mine on the Internet is 193 million. Only the New Federal State of China and I can have so many followers, and this is what the US president can’t even achieve. Think about what the number will be when all the Chinese people wake up.<br/><br/>4/19/2022【419五周年】最新数据显示，文贵在全网的粉丝共计1.93亿（不含国内），只有文贵和新中国联邦才有这么多粉丝，美国总统也做不到；当中国人都醒来的时候，这将是多大的数字<br/>

4/19/2022 【419 5th Anniversary】 Teng Wensheng and Wang Huning proposed "the next 30 years of the CCP" when Xi was still Vice President. At that time, Xi wanted to turn Communist China into a maritime power and a labor exporting country. He wants to obtain the West’s technologies by stealing, robbing, and deceiving the Western enterprises and to take down the US dollar such that the CCP can lead the world!<br/><br/>4/19/2022【419五周年】滕文生和王沪宁在习还是副主席的时候就提出"中共未来30年"，习当时认为要把中共国变成海洋大国和劳动力输出国，要通过偷、抢、骗西方企业来获取科技并打垮美元，从而让中共领导全世界<br/>

【419 5th Anniversary】Mr. Hao Haidong and Ms. Ye Zhaoying shared that the Russians around them have bank accounts closed by Spanish banks and can’t find jobs. Mr. Guo shared that the United States and Europe have 100% control over the list of all CCP and Russian government officials. The future of the CCP in the world will definitely be more miserable than that of Russia.<br/><br/>【419五周年】郝董叶女侠分享身边俄罗斯人在西班牙银行账户被封、找工作被拒。七哥分享美国和欧洲对所有中共和俄罗斯的政府工作人员的名单百分之百掌握，共产党未来在全世界肯定比俄罗斯还惨。<br/>

【419 5th Anniversary】Mr. Miles Guo broke the news that then German Chancellor Angela Merkel flew on Wu Xiaohui's private jet to China for a secret meeting with Xi Jinping. This is one of the reasons why Wu Xiaohui must be taken out.<br/><br/>【419五周年】郭文贵先生爆料时任德国总理的默克尔搭乘吴小晖的私人飞机飞往中共国密会习近平。这也是为什么吴小晖必须被干掉的原因之一。<br/><br/>

4/19/2022 【419 5th Anniversary]】419 was absolutely a new start of the Chinese feminist movement, the moral corruption of Chinese society is definitely because the Chinese men are not strong enough.<br/><br/>4/19/2022【419五周年】：419绝对是中国女权运动新的开始，中国这些年整个的堕落就是因为男性“举而不坚”。<br/><br/>

4/19/2022 【419 5th Anniversary】Not many people believed that we could take down the Chinese Communist Party five years ago. However, since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war, fundamental changes have occurred in the CCP’s system such that many insiders of the CCP have now realized that the CCP is the falling wall that is bound to collapse, and so is Xi Jinping. The Whistleblowers’ Movement has convinced them with our strength!<br/><br/>4/19/2022【419五周年】五年前，没人相信咱能灭共；但今天不一样了，自从俄乌战争开始，中共体制内发生了本质变化，中共内部很多人认清了共产党和习大神才是危墙，是爆料革命用实力让他们心服口服！<br/>

4/19/2022 【419 5th Anniversary】Meng Hongwei, the then president of Interpol, was very reluctant to issue the red notice to me. He was the first to tell me that the CCP was going to have the Interpol issue the red notice to me, begging me not to go against the CCP. He said exposing Wang Qishan’s dirt meant I would be doomed and that the moment I open my mouth in the live broadcast on April 19, 2017, would be the time of my whole family’s demise. The HNA arranged a mansion for Meng Hongwei to live in France, but he himself is finished.<br/><br/>4/19/2022【419五周年】时任国际刑警组织主席孟宏伟当时非常不情愿给文贵发红通，他最早告诉文贵中共要发红通，并恳求文贵不跟中共做对，他说爆王岐山的料就是万劫不复，在419直播一张开嘴就是文贵全家灭亡之时；海航曾给孟宏伟在法国安排大房子住，而他本人现已完蛋<br/>

4/19/2022 【419 5th Anniversary】 In Guo’s Seven Principles, the principle ‘Not against Xi’ is followed by an undeclared statement “but to destroy Xi”; Fu Zhenghua, Sun Lijun and Bruno Wu deserve the harshest punishment under law.<br/><br/>4/19/2022【419五周年】郭七条里的”不反习”其实是要灭了习；傅政华, 孙力军和吴征必须受到最严厉的法律制裁<br/>

【419 5th Anniversary】Mr. Miles Guo: The poison of the Chinese Communist Party is the poison from the most devilish power on earth, and it will not stop the harm until it is drained out completely.<br/><br/>【419五周年】郭文贵先生：中共的毒就像人间最魔鬼的力量的魔水，不把它排出去，它是停不了的。<br/>

4/19/2022 【419 5th Anniversary】Looking back to April 19, 2017, the top CCP cadres believed Miles Guo was that collapsing wall in the famous Chinese proverbs “a wise man will never stand by a collapsing wall”; however, after 5 years, Mr. Guo has proved by using his own experiences that the evil China Communist Party is that collapsing wall and the New Federal State of China is the reliable support and backup for our Chinese, therefore, you can turn into a wise or foolish person in one thought<br/><br/>4/19/2022【419五周年】回望五年前的419，中共高层认为文贵是“君子不立危墙之下“的危墙，而历经五年，文贵先生用亲身证明中共才是危墙，新中国联邦是中国人可依赖的靠山，智者和蠢者只在一线间！<br/>

【419 5th Anniversary】Mr. Miles Guo expresses that all the whistleblowing that failed to end 5 years ago on 419 will gradually come to light in the future: whether it is Wang Qishan's money, Liu Chengjie's dad, and the relationship between the CCP and Wall Street.<br/><br/>【419五周年】郭文贵先生表示，5年前419未能结束的爆料未来都会逐渐曝光：无论是王岐山的钱、刘呈杰的爹，以及中共同华尔街的关系。<br/><br/>
