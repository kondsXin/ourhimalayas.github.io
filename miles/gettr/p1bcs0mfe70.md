5/24/2022 Miles Guo: I mentioned back in 2017 that Japan would become a permanent member of the UN. This is because I knew that the CCP's insane actions around the world would inevitably lead the US to contain the CCP by allowing Japan to become a permanent member. The CCP regime is not elected by the people, and its permanent membership in UN should belong to the Kuomintang, the Republic of China (Taiwan)

5/24/2022 文贵直播: 文贵早在2017年就提过日本会成为联合国常任理事国。因为文贵深知中共在全世界的疯狂行为必然导致美国通过让日本入常来遏制中共。中共政权并非民选，它在联合国的席位本应属于国民党，中华民国
