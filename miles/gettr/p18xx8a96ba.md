5/8/2022 Miles Guo: Initiating the Whistleblowers' Movement and persisting until today, the influence of my parents on me is the foundation of everything. My parents maintained their living principles and ethics in their humble life, and let their sons grow up healthily. Later, even when I became rich, my parents were never arrogant or domineering. My parents' deep antipathy toward the CCP had a huge impact on my determination to destroy the CCP!

5/8/2022 文贵直播：爆料革命走到今天，父母对文贵的影响是一切的根基。文贵父母在卑微的生活中把握住做人的原则让儿子们健康成长，即便文贵发达后也从不骄横跋扈。父母骨子里对中共政权的反感对日后文贵下决心灭共影响巨大！
