5/8/2022 Miles Guo: Not mentioning Xi Jinping in the headlines of People's Daily is not a sign that Xi lost his power. The Chinese people are willing to believe such a rumor because they always indulge in the wishful thinking that dictators would be taken out overnight. Xi Jinping will definitely attack Taiwan, and he has more power than ever. The Shanghai gang no longer exists in Communist China.

5/8/2022 文贵直播: 人民日报的头条新闻没提习近平并不是他出事了，人们愿意相信这种谣言是因为中国人总是幻想独裁者一夜被灭。习近平一定会打台湾，他的权力大到前所未有，中共国已没有上海帮！
