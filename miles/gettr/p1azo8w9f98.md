5/22/2022 Miles Guo: Solana, the so-called killer of Ethereum, uses its own unique blockchain technology and is actually like another BSN of Wang Qishan. Like Changpeng Zhao of Binance, Solana is also backed by the CCP. The main concern now is not the technology of the digital currency, but whether it is valuable. The stablecoins issued by entities that have no legal license, collude with the CCP, or can't be held accountable are not going to be stable.

5/22/2022 文贵直播：号称以太坊杀手的Solana采用了其独有的区块链技术，它其实是王岐山的BSN的翻版；跟币安赵长鹏一样，Solana背后也是中共；现在人们最关心的不是数字货币的技术，而是它值不值钱；无合法执照、和中共勾结或不承担法律责任的实体发行的稳定币都不会稳定
