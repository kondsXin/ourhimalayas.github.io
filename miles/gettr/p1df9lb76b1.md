6/9/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: Europe is pursuing legislation to support Taiwan. The Western insurance companies are going to decouple from the CCP insurance companies to prevent them from causing the Western financial system to collapse. After the 2nd anniversary of the New Federal State of China, the CCP has started to fight back with its state power. Fake accounts impersonating me appeared on YouTube and Twitter, and some media even falsely claimed that I submitted articles to them. The CCP hacked my phones and fellow fighters’ computers. The CCP is declining, while we are on the rise!

6/9/2022 文贵盖特：欧洲推出支持台湾法！西方保险公司要和中共保险公司脱钩以防其造成西方金融崩溃；新中国联邦两周年庆典后中共以一国之力开始反击，油管和推特出现文贵假账号，有媒体还说文贵给他们投稿，中共黑文贵的手机和战友的电脑；中共在往下走，我们在往上走！
