5/6/2022 Miles Guo: These people in the photo have witnessed my relationship with the people, my relationship with money, and my relationship with international professionals. The Chinese people who are under the CCP's tyranny have the shortcomings such as being selfish and cowardly, and merely focusing on short-term goals and profits. This is due to their lack of faith. Only those who are good to their families can be good to the fellow fighters of the New Federal State of China. The people I am most grateful to and love the most are not related to me by blood.

5/6/2022 文贵直播: 照片上的这几个人见证了文贵和人的关系，和钱的关系，和国际专业人士的合作等关系；中国人自私懦弱、急功近利等缺点都是中共邪恶统治下没有信仰导致的；对家人好的人才有可能对新中国联邦的战友好；文贵最感恩和最爱的几个人都是和自己没有血缘关系的
