5/18/2022 Miles Guo: Tether is controlled by Wang Qishan, the people behind Lufax like Peter Ma Mingzhe, and the Wall Street guys. Tether's purpose is to push the internationalization of the digital RMB. Tether is the CCP's risk hedging mechanism by serving as an alternative form of the US dollar following the CCP-US decoupling. The CCP can shut down Tether at any time, so it can immediately depreciate to 0. The CCP has collected the personal information of the investors of digital currency via Binance and Tether.
