5/25/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: Not only is there a shortage of water everywhere in Communist China, but there is less and less clean water available. The Lao Baixing under the CCP's rule can't afford to go to school, can't afford to buy a house, can't afford to get married, can't afford to have children, can't afford to get sick, and can't afford to die or get buried. The COVID vaccine disaster will be far more catastrophic than any other disaster!

5/25/2022 文贵盖特：中共国不仅各地缺水而且干净的水越来越少；中共治下的老百姓上不起学、买不起房、结不起婚、生不起孩子、病不起、死不起、埋不起；疫苗灾难将远超其他任何灾难！
