5/15/2022 Miles Guo: One of the authors of the Stanford report is the mediator between YouTube and myself, as well as Wang Enge and myself! Under the intimidation of the CCP, YouTube dared not to show the real viewing data of my live broadcast; through his own Twitter account, Wang Enge sought reconciliation with me, therefore I canceled my plan of taking legal actions against Wang's son and daughter-in-law.

5/15/2022 文贵直播：斯坦福报告的参与人之一是文贵和YouTube、文贵和王恩哥之间的调解人！在共产党的威胁下，YouTube不敢显示文贵直播的真实数据；王恩哥在他的推特账号向文贵求和，文贵最后没有对王的儿子儿媳采取法律措施。
