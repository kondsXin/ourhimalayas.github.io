5/3/2022 Miles Guo: The photo of Mr. He Lingle and I riding in a limo to meet the people from the Morgan Group shows us the importance of seeing through life and death and sticking to our faith. The gods created by the CCP are all lies, while I remain true to my original aspirations without engaging in the cult of personality. The Whistleblowers' Movement does not create gods!
