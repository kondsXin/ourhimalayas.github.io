Chinese people have no food to eat, the second Great Famine is coming. The Chinese Communist Party(CCP)’s economy is collapsing and there is no money to import food. Nearly 40 million people were starved to death in the Great Famine. How many people will be taken away by the second great famine? The only solution is to take down the CCP.

中国老百姓无粮可吃、第二次大饥荒即将到来

4月29日郭文贵先生在Gettr爆料，中国老百姓面临粮食食品危机。中共内部预测，即将到来的汛期水灾威胁长江、黄河流域的粮食生产。同时，中共经济崩塌，没钱进口粮食。今年老百姓无粮可吃！大饥荒曾经饿死近4000万人，第二次大饥荒又将带走多少人？中国人还有选择吗？只有推翻共产党。
