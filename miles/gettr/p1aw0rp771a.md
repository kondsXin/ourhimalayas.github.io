Steve  Wynn, an Unregistered Agent of the People’s Republic of China

This Case Will Completely Destroy the CCP's Connections & Layout In the United States

Reuters: The U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday (May 17th) accused Steve Wynn, the former CEO of Wynn Resorts, of being an agent representing Communist China to lobby then-President Donald Trump to deport Mr. Miles Guo in 2017.

This case will expose many who have connections to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), including President Trump and President Biden. Eventually, this case will bring bipartisan legislation to dig out all traitors in the U.S., to take down the CCP, and to support the New Federal State of China.
