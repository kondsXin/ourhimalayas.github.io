🆘🇺🇦🆘【Report from NFSC's #UkraineRescue by #Nicole】
A Christian from Norway is worried about the religious freedom of Christians living in China. He loves Chinese history and culture.  Chinese people should have a good government, which represents freedom. The German volunteers next to him said that the New Federal State of China is beautiful and wonderful. We need people, who like the new Chinese people, to stand up and tell the truth.
