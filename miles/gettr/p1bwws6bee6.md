5/29/2022 Miles Guo: In October 2021, the US government informed the CCP that they will surely investigate the origins of the CCP virus, as did Europe. Thus, the CCP started to implement the zero-COVID policy to get rid of the COVID-19 traceability and satisfy its domestic and international political needs. Communist China’s domestic political and economic crises are on the brink of collapse. The CCP's real estate sector is bound to collapse.

5/29/2022 文贵直播：2021年10月美国政府告诉中共一定会进行病毒溯源，欧洲也表示会进行溯源，于是中共便开始了清零政策以摆脱病毒溯源并满足其国内和国际的政治需求，中共国的政治、经济已到崩溃的边缘，房地产一定会崩！
