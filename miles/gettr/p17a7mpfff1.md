4/26/2022 Miles Guo's GETTR: The PAX case has been successfully turned into a criminal case, and this is of great significance to the Whistleblowers' Movement and the New Federal State of China! The CCP agents involved in this case such as Bruno Wu and Weijian Shan, the law firm called O'Melveny, and Richard Frankel of CGI will all be brought to justice!

4/26/2022 文贵盖特：PAX的案子成功转为刑事案件对爆料革命和新中国联邦意义重大！牵涉这个案子的吴征和单伟建等中共特务、O‘Melveny律师事务所和CGI的Richard Frankel等人都将被绳之以法！
