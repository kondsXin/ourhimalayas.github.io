6/12/2022 Miles Guo: I had a conversation with someone in charge of military contact between the US and Communist China, and it confirmed my intelligence that Putin attempted twice to use nuclear weapons a month ago, but was stopped by his nuclear weapon deployment committee because those people did not want to die together with Putin;  when I asked this person: if the CCP attacks Taiwan, will the US deploy its killer weapon and completely destroy the 38000 military bases of the CCP? He gave a firm answer: absolutely!

6/12/2022 文贵直播：和一位负责中美军事联络的大佬交谈，验证了文贵之前的情报：普京一个月前曾两次想动用核武, 但被内部程序制止，因其他人不想和普京一起死；当文贵问该大佬若中共打台湾，美国是否动用杀手锏彻底摧毁中共38000个军事基地时，他肯定地回答：一定会！
