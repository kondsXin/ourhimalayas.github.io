6/8/2022 Miles Guo: Due to a series of threats and the false positive COVID test of our fellow fighters, people in charge of my security from the local government, Mr Bannon and my own security team were all against that I participated the June 4th celebration on site; however I insisted on going on site and hugged our fellow fighters despite the objection from my security team; in my eyes, our fellow fighters are my brothers and sisters. Their lives are as precious as my own!

6/8/2022 文贵直播：由于一系列的威胁和病毒假阳性测试，当地政府负责保护我的部门，班农先生和我的安保团队都坚决反对我到现场参加64庆典；但文贵坚持到场并不顾安保团队反对，与战友拥抱；因为在文贵眼里，战友就是兄弟姐妹，他们的生命同样宝贵！
