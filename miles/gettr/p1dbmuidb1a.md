Morgan and Rothschild Families attended the 2nd anniversary celebration of the New Federal State of China

On June 8, Mr. Miles Guo blew the whistle on Gettr that the Morgan family attended the  2nd anniversary celebration of the New Federal State of China(NFSC). There was also a member from the Rothschild family, who appeared as a bodyguard, participated and observe the ceremony. Mr. Guo has always insisted that the extermination of the Chinese Communist Party depends on strength and power, and the participation of the two prominent families in the ceremony of the NFSC is a proof of power, and the swamp chose to stand with the NFSC and helped the Ukraine rescue is another proof. Strength and power comes from action, and action is more important than anything else.
