It is very sad to see some animals are living better than hundreds of millions of Chinese people who are going through a tough time during the lockdown. Many products sold to Western countries are made by slaved Chinese prisoners. Chinese people need the international community's support to be free from Communism and take down the CCP.
看到一些动物比数以亿计的在疫情封锁下受难的中国人生活得更好，这是非常可悲的。许多销往西方国家的产品是由被奴役的中国囚犯制造的。中国人民需要国际社会的支持，以摆脱共产主义，打倒中共。
