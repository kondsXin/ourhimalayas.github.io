6/05/2022 Miles Guo’ GETTR: The celebration of the New Federal State of China’s second anniversary concluded successfully, with the new faces from each Himalaya Farm being the biggest highlights. The New Federal State of China is going straight up, while the CCP is going straight down and has no friends left in the world. Even if the COVID vaccine disaster had not happened, there would be no hope for living in Communist China. The New Federal State of China has been telling the whole world that the CCP does not represent the Chinese people and that the CCP’s crimes cannot be blamed on the overseas Chinese.

6/05/2022 文贵盖特：新中国联邦两周纪念活动圆满结束，各农场新人是最大的亮点；新中国联邦在直线上升，而中共在直线下坠，在国际上已无朋友；即便无疫苗灾难，活在中共国也没有希望；新中国联邦告诉了全世界中共不代表中国人，中共的罪恶不能由中国人和海外华人背负
