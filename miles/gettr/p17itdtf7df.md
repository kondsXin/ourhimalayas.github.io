4/28/2022 Miles Guo: Shanghai is waiting for food and supplies, and the lockdown will be lifted in Shanghai. Some areas of Beijing are under lockdown, and the entire Beijing will go on lockdown soon. The suffering of the people in Beijing will go far beyond your imagination. It is even snowing in Beijing in April. Anomalies occur before the advent of disasters, and the same happened before the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war.
