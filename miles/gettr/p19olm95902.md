5/13/2022 Miles Guo: We cannot expect all governments to admit the COVID vaccine disaster anytime soon as they are concerned about being asked to compensate the vaccine injuries. In addition, after admitting the truth of the vaccine disaster, those countries will most likely encounter serious economic, political and even military issues, but in the end, the truth will come out and be acknowledged. We, the people of the New Federal State of China and the unvaccinated nation, should focus on the future instead of worrying about the present

5/13/2022 文贵直播：期待世界各国承认疫苗灾难还为时过早，因为各国政府都害怕被索赔，同时也担心在承认疫苗灾难后，很可能导致严重经济政治甚至军事问题，但疫苗灾难真相最终会大白于天下。新中国联邦人不必纠结于此，作为无苗族，更应着眼于未来而非担心当下
