4/27/2022 Miles Guo: Liu He told his American buddy that among the 31 provincial level administrative divisions in Communist China, only three of them paid taxes to the central government in 2020, while the rest of the regions were all losing money. So, how could Communist China’s GDP grow? All those who have been speculating in Communist China and helping the CCP will lose all their money. The Americans used to have low prices and high salaries, but the inflation rate is extremely high recently. What kind of disasters are there going to be after the COVID vaccine disaster begins after May?

4/27/2022  文贵直播：刘鹤告诉其美国哥们，2020年中共国31个省级行政区只有三个地方给中央缴税，其他地区都赔钱，中共国GDP怎么可能增长呢？所有在中共国投机、帮中共的人都会把钱赔光；美国向来是物价低、工资高，但现在却高通胀，5月疫苗灾难开始后还会有什么灾难？
