A volunteer from Italy is interested in our vest (take down the CCP) and is interviewed by Nicole. He has lived in Xiamen, China for a few years as an English teacher. He is very surprised to see the new Chinese people here who are taking down the CCP. He has many friends in China and he wishes the Chinese people can have freedom of speech. Nicole introduces to him the truth about Covid-19 (CCP virus) and that the western mainstream media has been infiltrated by the CCP. He says he will try to download Gettr and help spread the word, and it is important that people help those freedom fighters inside China.一名来自意大利的义工对我们的灭共背心感兴趣并接受了妮可采访。他曾在厦门生活过，是一名英语老师。他非常惊讶于在这里看到灭共的新中国人。他有很多朋友在中共国，他希望中国人民能够获得言论自由。妮可向他介绍了中共病毒的真相和西方主流媒体被中共渗透的事实。他说他会试着下载盖特并帮助传播，帮助那些在中共国内的自由斗士非常重要。 #nfsc
