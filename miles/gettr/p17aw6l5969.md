[Ukraine Rescue] 04/26/2022 Nicole, our fellow fighter, interviewed a veteran who served in the British army for 16 years on the rescue front. He very much recognized that freedom is not free, and freedom can only be obtained through struggle. There are people represented by the CCP, the evil communist forces, which are supporting this war and providing military and financial aid (to Russia) for this war. 
Therefore, in order to get rid of communism and return the world to peace and freedom, it is necessary to fundamentally eliminate the dictatorship of Russia and the CCP.
【乌克兰救援】04/26/2022 妮可战友在救援前线采访了一位在英国军队服役了16年的退伍老兵，他非常认可自由不是免费的，自由是要通过斗争才能获得的，正是这些以中共为代表的邪恶的共产主义势力在支持这场战争，他们在为这场战争提供军事和财政援助。因此为摆脱共产主义还世界以和平和自由，就要从根本上消灭俄罗斯和中共的独裁统治。
