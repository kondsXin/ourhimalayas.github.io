6/10/2022 Miles Guo: As for the money we spent on the delicious food and fancy drinks enjoyed by the fellow fighters at the celebration of the 2nd anniversary of the New Federal State of China, not a dime came from Communist China. This shows that we can live much better without the CCP! I was able to attend our celebration on site, meaning that I not only can let go of the safety of my life, but I also put my trust in the fellow fighters above all else, and I believe I can handle the situation.
