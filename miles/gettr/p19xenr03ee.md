5/15/2022  Xi Jinping has serious health issues. Besides the brain surgery to treat the tumor, his heart, pancreas, spleen and kidneys also have problems and have received surgeries. The biggest threat to his life is the C6 spinal cord injury he got when he was in Liang Jia He, which might kill him any time. We can say that Xi's health conditions determine the fate of Chinese people and the world, and we can expect an outcome by next July.

5/15/2022  习近平的身体状况不佳，除因脑瘤做了脑部手术外，习的心、胰腺、脾和肾也有问题，均已手术，习在梁家河时的颈椎伤或许随时要了他的命。可以说，习的身体状况关乎着中国人和世界的命运，明年七月前结果揭晓。
