【Ukraine Rescue】04/30/2022 On the front lines of Medica, the Polish and NFSC volunteers work together to rescue cats and dogs. The animals also have their own passports and are being sent to Poland. Meanwhile, our fellow Chinese in Shanghai and Beijing are now living in worse conditions than the cats and dogs here. That's why we're standing out here and taking down the evil CCP.

【乌克兰救援】04/30/2022  在梅迪卡的前线，波兰人和新中国联邦人一起救助小猫小狗，这些动物还有自己的护照，正在被送入波兰。而在上海，北京隔离的同胞现在过的连这里的小猫小狗都不如。这就是为什么我们要站在这里，并且干掉邪恶共产党的原因。
