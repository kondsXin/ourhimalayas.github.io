5/19/2022 Miles Guo: In the past 24 hours, the Chinese Communist Party has been dumping stocks in the world and exchanging high-quality assets for the Hong Kong dollar, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, and certain currencies in the Middle East. This is the CCP’s preparation for the seizure of its overseas assets. In contrast, because the Chinese people are treated as slaves like animals, they have nothing to sell and are living in the hell, where they cannot afford to live or even die.
