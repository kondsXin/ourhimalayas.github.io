6/5/2022 Miles Guo with the 2nd gen. of the fellow fighters of the Whistleblowers’ Movement: The celebration of the second anniversary of the New Federal State of China is fundamentally different from last year’s celebration. Because I participated in the celebration on site this year, and everyone has seen the real accomplishment of our cause to take down the CCP - We are the unvaccinated, and we have the Himalaya Coin, GFashion, and hope. The Himalaya Global Alliance should take the credit for its great organizational work.

6/5/2022 文贵与爆二代：新中国联邦两周年庆典与去年庆典有本质区别，因为今年文贵参加了现场活动，大家看到了灭共的真实结果 - 无苗有币有GFashion还有希望，联盟的组织工作功不可没
