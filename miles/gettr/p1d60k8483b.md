Chinese Communist Party Has Begun Posthumous Arrangements Amid Bad Situation
During a live broadcast of the second anniversary of the New Federal State of China, Mr. Miles Guo revealed that the Chinese Communist Party has begun to make posthumous arrangements in response to possible U.S. sanctions against them.

The third is to separate the relationship between the CCP's domestic financial institutions and foreign money.
