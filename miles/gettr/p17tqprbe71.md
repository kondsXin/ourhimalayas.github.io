Nicole interviewed a Dutch volunteer, he said that the global expansion of the CCP threatens the free world, and The CCP buys western politicians with money because of their greed for profits. The consequences are very serious, which is equivalent to selling out freedom and sovereignty, and they will definitely pay a heavy price in the end.

妮可采访一位荷兰义工, 他说，中共在全球的扩张威胁了自由世界，西方政客因为贪图利益被中共用钱收买，后果是很严重的，等于是出卖了自由和主权，最后一定会付出沉重的代价。
