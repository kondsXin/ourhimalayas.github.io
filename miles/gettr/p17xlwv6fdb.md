5/1/2022 Miles Guo: The New Federal State of China and the Whistleblowers' Movement have had a profound impact on the world, with the ideas of the New Federal State of China and the Way of Righteousness being widely accepted. The shutdown of Duowei News is not a simple matter, and many CCP pawns have stopped smearing me. The CCP has really run out of money and fears the Whistleblowers' Movement. The legislation pushed by the New Federal State of China is far more harmful and destructive to the CCP than what you have seen.
