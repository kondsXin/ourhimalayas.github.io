Nicole interviewed a Dutch volunteer,  he admires the courage and wisdom of Mr. Miles Guo, who warned the Western world of the CCP's BGY plan as early as five years ago at the National Press Club in Washington, DC, USA. He said that Mr. Miles Guo, in order to let the world know the truth, single-handedly fought against the forces of evil and suffered many blows before more people understood the truth. He must be a brave and tough man. 

妮可采访一位荷兰义工, 他佩服郭先生的勇气和智慧，早在5年前就在美国华盛顿的国家新闻俱乐部（National Press Club)提醒西方世界不要被中共蓝金黄。他说，郭先生为了让世界知道真相，一个人单挑邪恶势力，受了很多打击，才让更多的人明白了真相。郭先生一定是一个勇敢和坚强的人。
