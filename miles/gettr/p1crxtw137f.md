【NFSC 2nd Anniversary 】06/04/2022 Steve Bannon: It's an effort we have to undertake to get the New Federal State of China recognized within the near future. It’s going to be very difficult. But look at how many accomplishments the members of the New Federal State of China have finished in a year. So nothing can stop us. The only thing that can stop us is ourselves. Keep on working hard, good things will happen. 

【新中国联邦2周年庆典】06/04/2022 史蒂夫·班农：我们要努力实现新中国联邦主权近期内被承认。这将非常艰难。但看看新中国联邦人一年内取得的成就。没有什么能阻止我们，唯一能阻止我们的是我们自己。继续努力工作，美好的事情将会发生。
