5/25/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: The CCP does not allow the Chinese to sell their shares of Hong Kong stock and China concepts stock, and the SEC will certainly delist the entire China concepts stock. Many people are hoarding food in the countries with good harvests, and the Russian troops are looting grain in Ukraine and selling it at high prices. The real estate prices in the US are soaring, while gas prices in the West are skyrocketing. The tycoons, whose wealth is shrinking, have started to stock up food. The food crisis in China will be even more catastrophic. 100 million Chinese starved to death during the 3 years of Great Famine.

5/25/2022 文贵盖特：中共不许中国人卖港股和中概股的股票，SEC会让所有中概股退市；在收成好的国家有很多人囤粮；俄军在乌克兰抢粮并高价卖出；美国房价大涨伴随着西方各国油价飙升，富豪们财富缩水并开始备粮；中共国的粮食危机将更严重，三年大饥荒饿死了1亿人
