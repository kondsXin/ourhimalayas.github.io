Student protests are ineffective and the combined factors can take down the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)

On May 29, Mr. Miles Guo blew the whistle that the student protests are ineffective in China, and will eventually sap social confidence and hope. The CCP completely control the student movement because it was founded on protests and violence. Without true faith, the more violent the protests are, the more they are used by the CCP and eventually they become tools of the political fight. In the Internet era the CCP arrests people accurately. The CCP controls a powerful military and judiciary which is easy to supress students. The New Federal State of China and the Whistleblower Movement have the strength and talents, and the combined factors can take down the CCP!
