【Ukraine Rescue】05/02/2022 A mother and son from Moscow say that, like the Communist China, there is no freedom of speech in Russia under Putin; and like the new Chinese people from the NFSC, they come here to show the world that they do not support their own government. They are convinced that they can see the overthrow of the communist dictatorship in their lifetime, and they are fighting for that dream.

【乌克兰救援】05/02/2022 一对来自莫斯科的母子说，和中共国一样，普京统治下的俄罗斯没有言论自由；而与新中国联邦人一样，他们来到这里就是为了向世界表明，他们不支持自己的政府。他们坚信在有生之年能看到推翻共产独裁，并为这个梦想而奋斗。
