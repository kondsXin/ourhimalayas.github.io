4/27/2022 Ukraine Rescue: A famous British rescue organization delivered supplies to us and paid a special visit to the tent of the New Federal State of China, indicating that our rescue operation is becoming increasingly well-known. Many volunteers from different countries are happy to see us erecting the billboard and would want to use it to display our slogans in different languages to express our shared voice from the bottom of our hearts to take down the CCP. This billboard is telling the world that we are the citizens of the New Federal State of China!
