Nazar,  a Ukrainian break-dancer, who loves peace, freedom, and independence, has a typical Ukrainian spirit to fight for the pride of their country. He sometimes had difficulty dancing, as people are losing their lives on the battlefield. But he has overcome it by thinking that the military forces are working on their battlefield, and he is working in his field, too. He loves Chinese tea, people, and culture. He wants to share Chinese tea in his tea project and promote Chinese culture in Ukraine, and he wishes to be able to travel to China.

Nazar是一位热爱和平、自由和独立的乌克兰霹雳舞者，具有典型的乌克兰精神，为祖国的骄傲而战。他有时练习跳舞很困难，因为（想到）人们在战场上失去了生命。但他克服了这一点，认为军队在他们的战场上工作，而他也在自己的领域里工作。他喜欢中国的茶、人和文化。他想在他的茶叶项目中分享中国茶叶，在乌克兰推广中国文化，并希望能够到中国旅行。
