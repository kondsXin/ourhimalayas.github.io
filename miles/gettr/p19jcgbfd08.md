5/12/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: In the face of the economic and humanitarian disasters around the world, family members and relatives are extremely important. Only if you treat other fellow fighters more kindly and sincerely than your family members, can you deserve to be called “the fellow fighter of the Whistleblowers’ Movement”.

5/12/2022 文贵盖特：在全世界的经济灾难和人道灾难面前，家人和亲人无比重要；只有对待战友比亲人更亲、更真诚，你才能配得上被称作爆料革命战友！
