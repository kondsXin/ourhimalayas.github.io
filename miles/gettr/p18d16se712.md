Precious Memories
In 1991 I just got out of the Qingfeng detention center and met my cellmates who were released earlier.
In 1992 I owned a “Boss” furniture factory at Zhengzhou using a fancy cell phone, and met the representatives from Zeng Qinghong’s family.
In 1993 I built Yuda Palace Hotel as a real estate developer.
In 1994 I attended a board meeting of Yuda Group in Hong Kong, and took a private jet to visit San Francisco, New York, New York.

珍贵的回忆
1991：刚出青峰看守所，与比我早出去的狱友们相见
1992：我在郑州拥有大老板家具厂，拿着大哥大，与曾庆红家族的代表相见
1993：我以房地产开发商的身份建成郑州裕达别墅
1994：我在香港参加裕达董事会，乘私人飞机游览旧金山、华盛顿和纽约
