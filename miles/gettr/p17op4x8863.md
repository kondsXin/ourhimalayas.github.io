Fellow fighter Xiaoxiaosu interviews the Spanish rescue team leader Basel. Basel likes the New Federal State of China (NFSC) hat very much and is happy wearing it. When asked about his thoughts about our mission to take down the CCP, he says communism is a lie, and it makes one person rich and leaves a whole country poor. He thinks the NFSC is the new reality and what people need.  He loves our tent very much and loves our NFSC people.

小小酥战友采访西班牙救援团队的领队Basel。Basel非常喜欢新中国联邦的帽子，戴上帽子后很高兴。当被问到关于我们消灭中共的使命的想法时，他说共产主义是一个谎言，它让一人致富而让整个国家贫穷。他认为新中国联邦是新的现实（未来），并且是人民所需。他非常喜爱我们的帐篷，并且非常爱我们新中国联邦人。
