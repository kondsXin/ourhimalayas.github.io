6/7/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: Peking University’s Li You does whatever it takes to achieve his goals and has no conscience, law, or moral boundaries. Li You set up Vice Minister Ma Jian, who had helped him a lot. Li You, together with Wang Enge and Zhu Shanlu, wanted to send female students from Peking University to sleep with me. This indicates the corruption of Peking University that cultivated a large number of CCP officials. Given the CCP is rotten to the core, will it allow the Western enterprises to take away the money they made in Communist China?

6/7/2022 文贵盖特：北大的李友为达目的不择手段而且毫无良知、道德和法律底线，李友害了曾帮过他很多的马建副部长，还和王恩哥、朱善璐要给文贵送北大女学生，足见培养了中共大批官员的北大是如此之烂！腐烂至极的中共能让西方企业从中国拿走他们挣的钱吗？
