【NFSC 2nd Anniversary 】06/04/2022 The first elevator I took to go upstairs was hacked and stopped working. The world's top-notch bankruptcy law firm, where my bankruptcy attorney works, was also hacked and blacked out. The CCP would never allow our live broadcast to run smoothly, and we have prepared in case there would be a power outage anytime.

【新中国联邦2周年】06/04/2022 郭先生：今天上楼乘坐的第一个电梯被黑停了，文贵的破产律师所在的全球最牛的破产律师事务所也被黑停电，中共绝不会让直播顺利进行，我们已做好随时停电的准备
