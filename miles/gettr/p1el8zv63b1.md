6/8/2022 Miles Guo: To disrupt the 2nd anniversary of the New Federal State of China, the CCP hacked the elevator that I was in. This is exactly the same technique used by the CCP to cause Lady May to lose control on the Hudson River, and the blackout of two floors of the office building of the BR law firm, which was handling my bankruptcy case.

6/8/2022 文贵直播：为破坏新中国联邦2周年庆典，中共黑停了文贵乘坐的电梯；这种卑劣的手段和他们蓄意引起Lady May在哈德逊河上失控，以及处理文贵破产官司的BR律师事务所发生的两层楼停电事件如出一辙！
