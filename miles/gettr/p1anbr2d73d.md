Mathew is a Volunteer coming from England to help the Ukrainian people to fight for their freedom, democracy, and freedom of speech. He was interviewed by Nicole, an NFSC volunteer.

He said what he wanted was to drive the evil out of this world, including people like President Putin and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). And he also expressed that he would do whatever he could to help to take down the CCP. He wished everything would be fine and our NFSC volunteer could return home, and so as the Ukrainian people.
