Mr. Miles Guo brings the best gift to mothers around the world on Mother's Day.
Breaking news! The scientist who is also a General of the New Federal State of China (NFSC) is about to announce the latest antidote against the COVID vaccines with a cure rate of 99.9% for people who have been vaccinated for 4 shots or less. However, the efficacy of the antidote for people who have received 5 shots or more is uncertain.
The scientist is cautious and has not published the remedy because there are no tests on both children and those who have had surgeries with chronic illnesses. Further confirmation is needed by the medical institutions. 
郭先生在母亲节带给全世界母亲最好的礼物。
爆好消息！新中国联邦的将军科学家即将公布对抗疫苗的最新解药药方。打了疫苗4针以内，99.9%的治愈率，超过4针就不一定了。
科学家谨慎没有公布的原因：一个是儿童，二是做过手术有传统疾病的。因为没有测试，需要一个医疗机构确认。
