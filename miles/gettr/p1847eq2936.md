【Ukraine Rescue】05/01/2022 A Ukrainian psychologist who is about to go back to Kyiv said that basically this is a problem of freedom in the 21 century. People should collaborate rather than stretch their muscles. It is time to eliminate all dictatorships around the world. In the future the world should be democratic and peaceful. Good people must fight for freedom to the end rather than be silent for too long.

【乌克兰救援】05/01/2022  一位即将返回基辅的乌克兰心理学者说，从本质上来说，这是一场21世纪的自由问题，人类应该合作，不应该比谁的拳头硬，是时候消灭全世界所有的独裁政权了。将来的世界应该是民主的，没有战争的。好人不应该沉默太久，要为了自由坚持到底。
