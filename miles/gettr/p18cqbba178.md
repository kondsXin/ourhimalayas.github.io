5/3/2022 Miles Guo: The photo of Mr. He and I was taken at my home. Mr. He knew my determination to take down the CCP. The reason why he could come over and had a conversation with me was because he totally understood my mind and supported me. Mr. He is a true fellow fighter, and is my bosom friend forever.

5/3/2022 文贵直播：贺老和文贵的旧照片当时是在我家拍摄的，贺老深知文贵灭共的决心，他当时能过来和我推心置腹地探讨和对话，就是因为他完全理解我的内心世界，贺老是真战友，好知己。
