May 2nd, 2022, many media report that Putin was diagnosed with abdominal cancer a year and a half ago and has Parkinson's disease, may undergo cancer surgery in the near future and temporarily hand power to another person.
 Since March 2nd, 2022, Miles Guo has repeatedly exposed in Mile Grand Live that Putin's health is definitely failing, Putin has had two surgeries and one of which is on his kidney. Miles Guo told some people in the Middle East and the UK five years ago that Putin would be dead by 2025.

2022年5月2日，多家媒体报导了普京将要进行癌症手术。普京一年半前已经罹癌，並罹患帕金森氏症，可能在近日进行癌症手术，权力可能会临时移交他人。
而从2022年3月2日开始，郭文贵先生曾多次在文贵大直播中爆料普京身体不行，做过两次手术，其中一次是肾的手术。文贵先生並曾在五年前曾告诉中东、英国人 "普京过不了2025年"
