【NFSC 2nd Anniversary 】06/04/2022  Mr. Steve Bannon believes that we are heading towards an economic catastrophe, and the Chinese Communist Party is the root cause of everything. However, the elites around the world won't hold the CCP accountable for what it has done to the world. Even thought this catastrophe is inevitable, it will wash away the CCP and bring a significant change in China

【新中国联邦2周年】06/04/2022： 班农先生认为，我们正步入一场经济大浩劫，中共正是这场灾难的制造者，但世界精英们不会对中共进行追责。虽然这场浩劫不可避免，但它会帮助世界淘汰掉中共，为中国人民会带来历史的新变革。
