20号公布,公布完的第二天
(SPAC’s stock ) was announced on the 20th , and on the next day

叭股票就从4万手变成了600万手
the stock trade volume had gone from 40 thousand shares to 6 million, wow

11家基金大买大进
11 foundations had purchased huge amounts of these shares

也就自己买自己炒呗（股票）最高达到174
They were playing the stock market trade within themselves, the highest price went up to $174

这一定是内部交易和操纵股市
This must be insider trading and manipulation of the stock market

这个时候的MAGA
Right in that time, the (Make America Great Again) MAGA

川普总统的MAGA组织
President Trump’s MAGA Organization

MAGA组织的钱，蓝领的钱就进来了
The money from the MAGA organization, the blue-collar’s money came in

甚至有些人想投机的人就跟着进来了
Even some people who want to speculate have jointed in

他们的目的就是让这些人把你干掉
Their (The CCP) goal is to let these people take you down

把你的钱卷走
and to wash out your money

那么这个时候大家要看到
Now you all need to notice that

就在（股票）炒到174的时候
when this stock was trading up to the price of $174

瞬间回到100、94
it flashed back to $100, then $94

然后关闭市场
and followed by the market closed

星期五回到了45美金
It went back to $45 on Friday

接下来的2周到3周，在未来5周以内最关键的
The next 2 to 3 weeks, the following 5 weeks are the most critical

那么在当时（股价）上到174 的时候市值多少钱
So, how much was the market value when it went up to $174?

也就是说在市场卖出的一共是
In other words, the total sold in the market was

22.80个Million，2280万股
22.80 Million, 22.8 million shares

最高的时候乘以174
It multiplies by $174 which is the highest price

值多少钱大家算过吗？
Have you ever calculated how much it is worth?

100多亿美元，快170亿美元了
it’s more than 10 billion U.S. dollars, it’s almost 17 billion U.S. dollars

就这突然间（市值）就上了170亿去了
Just this suddenly, (the market value) went up to 17 billion dollars

从170亿，吧唧给打回来了
but then it was quickly called back from 17 billion dollars

变成了90多块钱的时候也100多亿美元
It was still worth more than 10 billion dollars when the share price dropped to $90

也100多亿美元
It was worth more than 10 billion dollars

那家伙了不得了
That was incredible

川普总统的3个亿美元就2.96亿美元
President Trump’s 300 million US dollars, although it just 296 million US dollars

是肯定是他了
It was certainly his (money)

他如果有25%（股权）的话
If he has 25% of the equity

按照现在的（股价）
according to the current share price

他得拿走10亿美元
he could take away 1 billion dollars

如果90%的话
If it’s 90% of the equity

他拿走几十亿美元
he could take away millions of dollars

那么最后
So finally

我现在告诉战友的事情
the business that I’m telling my fellow fighters now

这些钱背后大家都知道
is that everyone knows what behind these money

全都是共产党的基金
All these are the CCP’s foundations

PAG、吴征、Sam Numberg、运鸿
PAG, Bruno Wu, Sam Numberg, and Yunhong

中国对外合作所有投资机构
as well as all investment institutions in China’s foreign cooperation

包括Jack Ma的
including Jack Ma’s

全部弄走
the total amount that has been washed out

大概50亿美元
is approximately 5 billion dollars

我可以（确定）大家别吓懵了
Please don’t be shocked, I can confirm that

大概洗走50亿到80亿美元之间
approximately 5 to 8 billion US dollars has been washed out

惊天的数字啊
It’s a shocking number

是美国SPAC有史以来最快最高增长（的股票）
(The stock) is the fastest and highest growth in the history of SPAC in the US

最快就是涨的最快落得最快
The fastest means that the price shot up and went down in the fastest speeds

这个中间的操作时间最短，钱被洗走最快的
and the operation time was the shortest, as well as the money laundered was the fastest

什么都是最快，就是共产党干的
Everything was the fastest, that was manipulated by the Communist Party
