**郭文贵
Miles Guo**

这个女人，这个Isobel Yeung和VICE和HBO之阴歹
This woman, how evil of Isobel, VICE, and HBO

我告诉你文疯而动
let me tell you Wenfeng,

在新西兰这种国家
in a country like New Zealand,

就像德国一样，就像那个奥地利是一样的
Germany and Austria

历史上永远是重复的
this will always be repeated in history

就奥地利这个小破国家就永远培养这种独裁
Just a small poor country like Austria has cultivated this dictatorship forever

看这次（强制）疫苗
Looking at this (mandatory) vaccine,

它又是一马前锋，走极端
it is once again a striker, going to extremes

新西兰这种国家
The countries like New Zealand,

还有像澳大利亚这种国家，像英国这种国家
as well as Australia and the United Kingdom,

它走极端的时候
when it goes to extremes,

你当地的华人永远是少数的
the local Chinese population will always be a minority

发生印尼排华事件真的一点都不遥远呐
and incidents like Indonesian anti-Chinese incidents would really not be far away

所以这个女人，还有这个采访之阴歹
That’s why the evilness of this woman（Isobel Yeung）and her interview

把华人置于全球各国的所谓的恐怖主义（势力），影响政治、改变你政治
would have put the Chinese people overseas on the list of the so-called terrorist power to influence politics and to change politic

你不处理它，它就改变你政治
It (Isobel’s interview fractionally published on VICE and HBO) will change the politics if you don’t deal with it

最后, 你要看到她采访
Finally, you have to see her interview

她在那块记录着, 她根本不在乎你怎么回答
She was taking note there and would be careless of how you answered at all

她把问题问出来就赢了
She had already achieved her goal upon asking questions

如果咱没有摄像机
If we didn’t have the recorder camera (at that time), we would not have the ability to explain ourselves,

你满身是嘴你也说不清啊
even if the body is full of mouth, but also can not explain myself

如果我嘴再笨点，你全身都是嘴, 你也憋死
If I was clumsy a little bit (during Isobel’s interview), I would be suffocated to death even though I have mouths all over my body

能憋死你每句话
Every sentence would have made you suffocate to death

滕彪说我乱伦我侄媳妇
Teng Biao defamed me saying that I was incest with my niece

结果变成了我说滕彪是乱伦
As result, he said that I criticized him the incest

你想有多可怕！
Think about it, how terrible it is!

GTV，她说我们是骗子
About GTV, She (Isobel) said that we are scammers

那很简单，谁被骗了？
That’s so simple, who was deceived?

这种垃圾话她能给你弄出去
She could push such trash words out

因为所有人看（时）没有人细琢磨，哎，对对对，他是骗子
because no one would ponder when watching and would agree that I’m a liar

然后最后说你觉得他怎么样？
Then, in the end, saying what do you think of him (Miles Guo)?

他会把中国人带入地狱
He would take the Chinese people to hell

我咋把中国人带入地狱？
How do I bring the Chinese people into hell?

我爆料我们四五年来，你有没有想过
Our whistleblower movement has been going on for 4 or 5 years, have you thought about that?

我们把（任何）一个中国人带入地狱了吗？
Have we ever brought any Chinese person to hell?

怎么能（说我们）把中国人带入地狱？
How can she say that we are bringing Chinese people into hell?

她让中国人恨我们
She makes the Chinese people hate us

你看到没有？
Have you realized that?

不但让美国、西方世界恨爆料革命
Not only she has made the United States and the Western world hate our whistleblower movement,

她让螃蟹的嘴说出来
but also made Pangxie expressed

中国人要恨这个爆料革命、新中国联邦
Chinese people need to have hatred on our whistleblower movement and the New Federal State of China

这个之阴歹跟当年印尼排华一模一样
This evilness is exactly the same as the Anti-Chinese incidents in Indonesia back then
