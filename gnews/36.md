**郭文贵
Miles Guo**

家天下
Families world

欺骗人的所谓的黑社会的劫社文化，叫劫社大纲
The so-called gangster culture that deceives people is called the gangster outline

咱们这叫什么？
What’s our outline called?

新中国联邦，联邦，联邦!
The New Federal State of China, federation!

咱们跟他们完全不同
We are totally different with them

他是右手，咱是左手
They use right hand but we use left hand

他是擦屁股的手
The hand they used is the one that wipe their butt

咱是手举向上天、摸着良心的
The hand that we used is the one that we raise to the God and touch our conscience

从来不会有任何政权、利益、名义之心的这样的一个新中国联邦的宣言
There has never been such a New Federal State of China declaration without any political power, interests, or a sense of reputation and morality

没有任何人去认真研究
No one has gone to study it closely

大家去看看
Let’s take a look,

第一章第一页倒数第四行
the fourth line from the bottom of the first page of Chapter 1,

你看看开始第四行的上头就明显的写着：灭共是正义的需要
if you look at the top of the fourth line at the beginning, it clearly says that destroying communism is the need of justice

然后你接下来很简单的宣言
after that, it’s a very self-explanatory declaration

你看看往下
Continue reading down,

每一个从天到地
everything from the sky to the earth,

从人到动物，从动物到植物
from humans to animals, plants,

从植物到环境、到山、到水
and from plants to the environment, the mountains and water,

没有我们不囊括进去的
there is nothing that we do not included

我们不仅说中国人的事
We not only talk about things of the Chinese

我们要说全人类的事
We want to talk about thins of the whole mankind

我们还说全天下的事
We also talk about the whole world

大家都知道去年发生了体育界最重要的彭帅事件
Everyone knows that the most important Peng Shuai incident in sports took place last year

彭帅和我东弟、颖妹妹，还不是一个重量级的，是吧？
Peng Shuai and our brother Hao Haidong, sister Ye Zhaoying are not the same weight-class, right?

发生了张高丽作为一个国家副总理
It happens that Zhang Gaoli, as a deputy prime minister of the country

天天代表着爹亲娘亲不如党亲的党
who is representing a party whose fathers and mothers were inferior to the party

张高丽告诉彭帅同志“宇宙无限大，地球是一粒沙”
Zhang Gaoli told Comrade Peng Shuai that the universe is infinite, and the earth is a grain of sand

但没有人问呢
But no one asked

谁是宇宙？谁是那个地球？谁是那个沙呢？
Who is the universe, who is that earth, and who is that sand?

没有人问过这些话
No one has asked these subjects

我憋了好几天了
I have been holding back for several days

我今天就憋着等东弟、颖妹妹
I am holding back today to wait for brother Hao Haidong and sister Ye Zhaoying

我东弟估计跟别人讲过这个
My brother Dong probably has already told others

宇宙无限大，地球是一粒沙
that the universe is infinite, and the earth is a grain of sand

然后意思我郝海东是宇宙
and then he meant himself is the universe

我是球星嘛，是吧？
because he’s a soccer player star. Right?

我颖妹妹肯定没干过
My sister Ye Zhaoying must had never done it (PengShuai’s situation) before

那意思我是宇宙，你是那一个沙子
So that she is the universe and you are a grain of sand

我想干啥就干啥，你跟我能比吗？
She can do whatever she wants, and no one can compare with

我宇宙当然是沙子的主人了，是吧？
Of course, as the universe, one should be the master of sand. Correct?

后来东弟决定不做那宇宙了
Later on, brother Hao Haidong had decided not to be that universe

也不跟人家玩一粒沙的游戏了
and also didn’t want to play the game of a grain of sand with others

他告诉大家，应该像这样
He told everyone similar to this

对天地、对人的敬意和爱意
how respect and love to the world and people

它叫新中国联邦
it is called the New Federal State of China
