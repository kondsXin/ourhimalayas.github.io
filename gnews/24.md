**郭文贵：**
**Miles Guo：**

我们有三样东西，新中国联邦说过
We have three things that the New Federal State of China has said

大家一定小心去看
You must look carefully

第一个，没有共产党第一件事情
First, the first thing without the Communist Party

把土地必须还给人民
The land must be returned to the people

很多人来问我这问题，国内的（战友）
Many people come to ask me this question, the domestic ( Comrades in Arms )

你怎么还呢？
How do you return it?

我说你如果不懂的话，看看西方工业革命怎么把土地给人民的
I said if you don’t understand, look at how the western industrial revolution gave land to the people

而且是永久产权
And it’s freehold

必须把土地给老百姓，这一条
The land must be returned to the people, this is first

第二个，所有银行欠的钱，包括房贷一概不能还
The second, all the money owed to the bank, including the mortgage can not be paid off

他说社会那不就乱了吗？
He asked “isn’t that society in chaos?”

我说你没有学过经济学，好好学学凯恩斯，还有这个大小史密斯讲的经济学理论
I said you have not studied economics, go to learn Keynesian economics, and learn economic theory from Adam Smith

财富是谁的呢？财富最终都是社会的
Whose wealth is it? Wealth will ultimately belong to the community

我们人类存在这个世界上，所有的房产，所有的金钱，所有的物质，你只是在你生存期间拥有了保管权
We humans exist in this world, all the property, all the money, all the material things, you just have custody of wealth during your existence

社会财富最好的分配就是继承权利和继承的法律
The best distribution of social wealth is inheritance rights and inheritance laws

我说我们解决了这一段的所有的占有权和把未来的继承权解决好
I said we gonna settle all the possessions in this section and settle the future inheritance

所有的帐是不用还的，因为中国人民活着的人
All the debts do not have to be paid, because the people who are alive in China

他们应该有资格，有能力继承他们几代人创造的财富和他生在这个土地上应有的人权，和这个土地上所有权的归属权，
They should be entitled and capable of inheriting the wealth they have created over the generations and the human rights to which they were born on this land, and the right to ownership of this land.

就应该是他们的，一切归零，重新开始，什么房卡、信用卡、银行贷款，
It should be theirs, everything goes to zero, start over, whatever house mortgage, credit cards, bank loans, all gone

那对不起，那时候有没有，他有十套房子，还有没有房子的，那对不起了
Is there such a situation when the time comes? There are people who have ten houses and there are people who don’t have houses, oh, we’re sorry

到那个时候，它就不会是绝对公平的
it won’t be absolutely fair

它只能叫做司法资源，管理资源，历史性的冻结分配状态
It can only be called a judicial resource, a management resource, a historical freeze on the state of distribution

这在资本论里边都说的非常清楚
It’s all very clear in “Das Kapital”

生产资料、生产价值
At that time, the means of production and production value

那就是到那个时候就是属于老百姓的，就是属于大家的
belong to the people, that is, to everyone

有没有其他的公平分配方式？有
Is there any other way of equitable distribution? Yes

比如说有人既没房，又没房贷，又没车贷
Let’s say someone has neither a home, a mortgage, nor a car payment

那给他什么？
So what does he get?

要把现在拥有的属于公共资源，要经过等比，就是大家平均完以后一个均值
In order to take the public resources that we have, we have to go through the equivalence, that is, an average value with everyone included

让他应该拥有，他不能吃亏
Give him the part he should have and not letting him lose out on it

这就是爆料革命，新联邦干掉共产党以后要做的
This is what the Whistleblowers Movement, the New Federal State of China to do after taking out the Communist Party

只有做到了现在的资源和财富的分配合理化
Only when the current distribution of resources and wealth is rationalized

被绝大多数人接受
and accepted by the vast majority of people

中国人才能放下负担走向未来
will Chinese people be able to put down its burden and move into the future
