According to the Central Epidemic Command Center, there are many CCP virus outbreaks in Taiwan, but the source of some virus infections cannot be identified. Eighty-three new cases were confirmed on the 27th, spreading all over Kaohsiung, Hsinchu, Shuangbei, Keelung, Taitung, and other counties and cities. The cluster cases at Keelung Snack Shop and Datan power plant continued rising, showing no signs of improvement. There were thirty-four new local confirmed cases on the 28th.

Notably, the sequence analysis found that the virus strains of the police cluster cases at Keelung Snack Bar are different than the strain of local cases in Taiwan. The virus strain was suspectly from Vietnam.

The Datan power plant cluster cases have drawn much attention because the power plant generates more than 10% of Taiwan’s electric power, and it is worried that the outbreak may affect the island’s power supply. Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Meihua said in an interview on the 28th that the positive cases had been quickly quarantined; still, there could be more cases at the Datan power plant. Because of the virus outbreak, the epidemic commander Chen Shizhong announced that the mask mandate will continue, although the mandatory planned to lift on April 1st. In an interview with the media, when he was asked if he “worried about Taiwan following in the footsteps of Hong Kong,” Chen hoped that it would not happen to Taiwan.

In addition, the CCP-virus outbreak in Shanghai led to the city’s lockdown by the district. Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Meihua reported to the Legislative Yuan Economic Committee that the Industrial Development Bureau contacted the Taiwan factories in Shanghai and confirmed that the production of the Taiwan factories went well, but the lockdown might impact the shipping of the products.
