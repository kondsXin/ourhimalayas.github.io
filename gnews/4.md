新中国联邦前线救援战友告诉我们，在梅迪卡的难民营中基本都是妇女和儿童。年龄在18-60岁之间的男人都留在乌克兰保卫家园。这首《多想活着》的反战音乐视频以蒙太奇的方式展示了俄罗斯入侵乌克兰造成的破坏。它描述了现实，恐怖，勇敢以及被强加在普通人身上的牺牲-他们只想活下去。活着只是为了去爱，与你黎明时一同醒来，享受灿烂的日出，一起下厨煮咖啡。活着是为了让孩子永不忘！为乌克兰祈祷！我们与乌克兰人民站在一起。音乐视频由德国纽伦堡正义农场的無遠弗届制作。

NFSC volunteers told us that there are almost all women and children in the refugee camps in Medyka. Men aged between 18 – 60 stayed in Ukraine to protect their homeland amid Russian invasion. The music video is a montage of scenes showing the devastation of the Russian Invasion of Ukraine. It depicts the realities, terror, bravery, and sacrifice being thrust upon normal people – who just want to live. To live just to love, to enjoy the crimson sunrise, to wake up with you at dawn and to take and brew a cup of coffee. Live to be remembered by children！Pray for Ukraine. We stand with Ukrainian people. This musical video is made by @noone\_Will from Himalaya Nuremberg Germany.
