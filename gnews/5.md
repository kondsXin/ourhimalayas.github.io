**郭文贵**
**Miles Guo**

我告诉你们，习躲过了13次的谋杀，这种暗杀都躲过13次，
I tell you that Xi has avoided 13 times assassinations, and he has survived 13 times all of these assassinations

你觉得习的未来，他的10年就能还躲另外13次，躲不过一次就结束了
Do you think Xi’s future will be able to avoid another 13 times in next 10 years, and it will be over if he does not avoid once

习近平他不知道人伦和自然之间的逻辑
Xi Jinping does not know the logic between human relations and nature

新中国联邦的发起人郭文贵最知道事物之间万物的逻辑
Guo Wengui (Miles) who the founder of the New Federal State of China, knows the logic of existence between all things

我相信有天，我相信有神，我相信大自然的逻辑和根据
I believe there is a God, I believe there is the Spirit, I believe in the logic and ba-sis of nature

习躲过13次，我要是习近平的话，我一定准备到明天就被干掉的这个准备
Xi has escaped 13 times, If I were Xi Jinping, I would be prepared to be killed tomorrow

你能躲过第14次吗？它是个基本的逻辑
Can you guarantee to escape the 14th time? It is a basic logic

你不但你没想到14次，你以为是千秋万代
Not only did Xi not expect the 14 times, Xi thought it will be for generations to come

你把所有的全中国人都当傻子，全世界当傻子
Xi treats all Chinese people as fools and the whole world as fools

我们在看待事物的时候，习不是他的文化决定他的思路
When we look at things, it is not Xi’s education that determines his thinking

一定记住习这个人，在决定他的思路是他的家庭
Xi’s way of thinking in deciding things comes from about his family of origin

他的姐姐的上吊自杀，文化大革命，他被3次被抓进少改所
His sister committed suicide by hanging herself, the Cultural Revolution, and he was arrested 3 times into the juvenile prison

在少改所他被打时他亲口跟我说的
He told me in person that he was beaten inside the juvenile prison

在里面，就是为了那半个窝头，把习给打得半死
When he was in the juvenile prison, Xi was beaten badly for half of the Wotou (corn bun)

习被按在地上，拿鞋底抽他的脸，习在路边被当马骑
Xi was pressed to the ground, his face was beaten with the shoe soles, Xi was ridden as a horse by the side of the road

3次少改所，习每次出来都是打的跟半残废似的
Three times in juvenile prison, Xi was beaten so badly every time then he came out

他又亲眼看到他爹16年失去自由，他跟习远平去看他爹
He saw his father lost his freedom for 16 years with his own eyes. He and Xi Yuanping（his little brother ） went to see his father

他爹当着他们面拉的屎，拿手里往嘴里吃
His father was eating his own shit in front of them and put them into his mouth with his hand

说你是谁呀，习近平都崩溃了，然后是他认不出习近平
and asked who they are, Xi Jinping fell apart, and his father couldn’t recognize Xi Jinping

他这种背景，他比咱还恨共产党，你千万记住，他说什么共产党
With his background, he hates the Communist Party more than we do, you must remember what he said about the Communist Party

我说去他大爷，他每天恨不得把这帮孙子都杀光
I said go to hell, he can’t wait to kill all these bastard every day

他让中国人致富，他觉得你当时打老子的时候
He made the Chinese people rich, he felt that I was beaten so badly then

我爹16年的时候，把我娘弄到深圳的时候，我们家什么结局
and my father lost 16 years of freedom, they sent my mother to Shenzhen, what was the result of our family?

邓小平又骗他爹，让他回去，说要当人大委员长
Deng Xiaoping lied to his father and told him to go back, saying that he would name him to be the chairman of the National People’s Congress

结果不让他去，他爹本来就疯了，又把他爹骗一把
As a result that he was not nominated, his father was so depressed and cheated again

真的是习仲勋提出的，当年的宝安县就是深圳这个镇
It was really proposed by Xi Zhongxun（Xi’s father）, Baoan County was the town of Shenzhen

往香港游每天杀几千人，血染成河,
that people swam and fled to Hong Kong, killing thousands of people every day, staining the river with blood

是习仲勋建议不要再杀人了, 建了特区
It was Xi Zhongxun who advised not to kill anymore and established the Special Economic Zone

真的是他爹说的，后来邓小平把这个功给弄走了
That was really said by his father and then Deng Xiaoping took away the merits

他多恼火啊，所以上来先把邓家灭了
He was so angry, so he came up to destroy the Deng family first

先把你欺骗我爹的邓家人，吴小晖全抓了
Wu Xiaohui from the Deng family who cheated my father was arrested in the first
