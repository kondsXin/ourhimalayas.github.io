空白支票公司这个经济形式
The economic form of the blank check company

一定会成为世界上
will certainly become

未来金融市场的主要工具
a main tool of the future financial market in the world

就是给你两年的时间
Let’s give you two years of time

还有你资金的去向
and the whereabouts of your funds

还有你的收购目标
as well as the purpose of your acquisition

就是开出的空白支票的公司，你不能有欺诈
which is the company that issued a blank check, and you cannot commit fraud

你就是 要不你买到你做到
That means either you can buy it and finish it

你把钱拿走
and walk away with the money

要不你把钱给拿回来
or you retreat the money back

但是这里边给你的几个规定是很干净的
But the rules given to you during these processes are very self-explained

你回到当时J.P摩根
back to the moment of JP Morgan

还有当时的罗斯柴尔德
and the moment of Rothschild

就是当时运作伦敦和美国市场的时候
It was when he was operating the London and U.S. markets

实际上,当时他达成的协议
In fact, It was the agreement he reached

这叫什么，叫世界全球金融市场的基础协议
It was call the foundation agreement of the world global financial market

实际上就是几条
Actually, it was just a few (protocol)

后来是各国根据自己的政府的要求呢
Afterward, it was all countries in accordance with the requirements of their own governments

他把它全给弄复杂化了
He made it all complicated

也就是政府垄断
which was called government monopoly

那么这又回到了最初的金融基础协议
So let’s route back to the original financial foundation agreement

实际上大家知道你是诚实的
In fact everyone knows that you are honest

这个方式是对的，是非常好的
This method is correct and very effective

就这个问题我参加过多少次世界级的讨论
I have participated so many world-class discussions on this subject

就在2014年以前
Prior to 2014

为什么我跟所有人说的不一样？
why what I said were different from everyone?

我说SPAC未来将是一个世界的金融走向、股市的走向
I said that the future of SPAC would be the direction of the world’s financial and stock markets

我从来不操作任何上市公司的
I have never manipulated any listed company

我从来不参与这种事情
I have never participated this kind of behaviors

我说所有今天全球的上市的规则，全是政府腐败
I said that all the global listing rules today are government corruption

收租、当中介人
collecting rents, being an intermediary agent

这是一些做Agent的一些手段
all these were some means of being agent

我说就应该回到SPAC这种模式
I said that we should go back to the SPAC model

当时（很多人）觉得我神经病
(Many people) thought I was crazy at that moment

现在你可以发现，从去年美国已经突涨了多少倍
But now you have noticed that how many times the U.S. market has risen sharply since last year

这是给真正的初创者(的机会)，实际上是很重要
This is the (opportunity) offering to a real start-ups, in fact, it’s very important

你担你的风险
You take your own risk

但你必须要诚实
but you must be honest

它是在诚实基础上
It’s based on the honesty

那今天我们看到了SPAC公司里边
So, today we have witnessed the inside of SPAC company

出现最多的就是不诚实，就是夸张
showing the most are the deception and exaggeration

它就是想骗钱
That’s scam

这是完全两个概念
These are two totally concepts

你来是犯罪目的来的和你到融资来的
either you come for a criminal purpose or you come for financing

这是两个完全不同的概念
These are two totally different concepts

这是当年我的发言
These is what I said back then

善意的融资者，会在这里得到天堂般的待遇
Well-meaning financiers will be treated like in heaven here

具有犯罪动机的
Those who have criminal motives

到这里来骗钱
come here to swindle money

你会感觉到，到这里就是人多钱傻
You will feel that there are too many people, the money is stupid

不骗白不骗
and it’s your lose if you don’t scam

但最后你毕竟死在这
But in the end you will die here after all
