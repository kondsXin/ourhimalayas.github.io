（在全球范围内运行 COVID 疫苗计划的所谓卫生专业人员不断重复“COVID 疫苗是普通疫苗，它是安全有效的”）

年轻运动员在参加运动时心脏骤停或死亡绝对不正常，但今年这种情况正在发生。 所有这些心脏问题和死亡都是在他们接种 COVID 疫苗后不久发生的。 虽然这可能发生在没有接种 COVID 疫苗的人身上，但绝对数字清楚地表明了唯一明显的原因。

因此，为了回应他们的声明，这里有一份非详尽且不断增长的年轻运动员名单，他们在接种一种或多种 COVID 疫苗后在 2021 年出现了重大医疗问题。 最初，其中许多没有被报道。 我们知道许多人被告知不要告诉任何人他们的不良反应，而媒体也没有报道他们。 它们在第一次 COVID 疫苗接种后开始发生。 主流媒体仍然没有报道最多，但体育新闻不能忽视足球运动员和其他明星在比赛中途因心脏病发作而倒下的事实，其中大约 50%的运动员死亡。

本报告未包括因“疾病**”**而缺阵的运动员

许多运动队现在有多名缺阵球员。 有几十个。 团队和大媒体都在隐瞒这一点，以为没人会注意到。 如果这些受损球员仅被报告为“疾病”，则不会在此报告中显示，但他们值得追踪，因为有这么多是不正常的。他们的免疫系统很可能受到“某些东西”的损害，因此任何微小的疾病免疫系统都防疫不了。 我们把它留给其他人来跟踪这些——我们全神贯注地处理下面这个列表的调查，从新检查以前的事实，利用新发现的信息进行微小的更正。 真相最终都会浮出水面。

（运动员倒地和死亡图表至 2021 年 12 月 15 日）

受伤清单

以下是一份非详尽的受伤报告清单。 大多数是心脏骤停。

心脏骤停

血凝块或血栓形成

中风

心律不齐

心律失常

神经病

死亡

随时更新的报告

随着新信息的添加，这个故事会随着时间的推移而更新。 如果您有我们还没有的信息证明，或者您有更正，请通过我们的联系表发送，并提供尽可能多的信息。 有用的信息包括此人的姓名、年龄、他们发生了什么、是否接种了 COVID 疫苗、死亡日期、任何新闻报道的链接。

特别感谢提供更正、发现我们遗漏的错误或提供我们不知道的新信息的读者。 现在这是一个真正的团队努力，我们对此表示赞赏。

对于认为这是正常现象的怀疑者，请在阅读本文后缀的（附列表**1**）中的**318**条运动员死亡和疾病记录或名称后，反复朗读以下 “金句”。

阅读以下列表每条信息后朗读此条**“**金句**”**

“COVID疫苗是一种普通的疫苗。 COVID 疫苗是安全的。 这些伤亡是正常的。”

注意：下面（附列表**2-5**）所列运动员疾病死亡报告不包含在本文章标题中的计数中

注意：由于文件不足或其他原因，列表2、列表3的报告全部没有包含在本文标题数字中。

还没有找到文档的案例（见附列表**2**）

调查正在进行中，到目前为止，在此部分中未找到任何新闻媒体文档。 某些名称可能拼写错误，日期可能有误，到目前为止，我们找到了 10 多个这样的正确细节， 现在我们将它们添加到（列表2），不将它们计入标题总数，直到找到文档。 任何援助将不胜感激。

可能与** Vax **无关（见附列表**3**）

没有足够的信息来确定这些衰竭或死亡是否与 COVID 疫苗接种有关。 需要更多的调查。 任何帮助将不胜感激，因为与正在进行的调查保持一致并不容易。 此处列出这些是因为它们在某些列表中显示为 vax 引起的，但我们认为目前没有足够的信息来决定，或者其他解释似乎推翻了 vax 引起的，例如癌症。

很可能与**Vax**无关（见附列表**4**）

这些衰竭或死亡很可能与 COVID 疫苗接种无关。

运动员对话

感谢许多人对本文事实的贡献

许多人为此做出了贡献，其中一些人通过向 Telegram 群组和其他网站报告而间接做出了贡献。 有很多重复，在某些情况下，人们报告了我们几个月来的事情，但每份报告都有帮助，因为有时会有一些我们以前没有的信息，比如日期、尸检报告、名字 拼写，或几个月前从未成为新闻报道的报道。 Chuck “Kali Muscle” Kirkendall 就是这种情况。 有用的网站包括 DVDbeaver。

最新更新（附列表**5**）：

这就是目前的名单……所有这些运动员在接种 COVID 疫苗后都出现了心脏问题。 在最初撰写本文时，已有 28 人死亡。 这不正常，但 10 天后，有 56 人死亡，而且数字还在攀升。 这种情况下，任何其他真正的疫苗早就从市场上撤下。 媒体会提问。 他们会向政府施压。 但他们不是。 政府正在继续播放电视、广播和报纸广告，鼓励人们打一针、二针、三针、四针。 也许这就是为什么主流媒体很少说话，因为他们正在为广告收取政府资金？

死亡和严重反应将持续到如此多的人死亡，以至于疫苗明显比它应该治疗的病毒差** 10 **到** 100 **倍。

这些运动员是矿井中的金丝雀，警告我们迫在眉睫的危险。它们被隐藏起来，所以不注意的人看不到警告。

我们只看到运动员，因为他们处于聚光灯下。无名小卒**——**即大多数公民**——**不会成为新闻。
