**What is the roll-out plan for Himalaya’s products and services?**

Coco: What Himalaya Exchange’s products and services have been rolled out to date?

Jesse： In April we launched our phase 1, which was the onboarding and KYC registration for our private placement participants. And this was really a tremendous success for us. We have already onboarded over 10,000 customers to date. So we are very excited about that. To this day, there was a very strong demand for our products among our private placement participants. So that really gives us a good idea moving forward that we got something that people want. And during this process, we used robust know-your-customer (KYC) procedures that really keep us safe from Money Laundering & Illegal activities on the platform.

After these customers were onboarded, they topped up their accounts to buy our HDO credit. It is worth noting here really what a great job our compliance team did and our banking advisors, especially during these pandemic days. There is a lot of struggles with people not being in the office. I think we have been doing very well handling those challenges.

In July we launched phase 2 – the Quick Buy Function, which allowed customers with HDO to purchase their allocated amount. The exchange will open trading on the pair when it launches in the coming weeks.

**What is coming next?**

Coco: What is the next?

Jesse: That will be the launch of the Himalaya Exchange platform to everyone. We are very looking forward to that. Users will be able to top up accounts, buy our credits and perform trading functions on the web platform.

Moving forward, we are going to be adding more crypto-asset pairs. So we are looking forward to that.

And also, users will be able to use not just USD, but other fiat currencies to top up their accounts as well.

**What to expect in the future?  Himalaya Exchange App**

Jesse: So I can get into what we are going to in the future as well if you let me elaborate a little bit on that. So we have the Himalaya Pay App, which is coming up, it is really going to allow our users to transfer these crypto-assets among each other and in our ecosystem.  It is probably the most efficient and secure way they will be able to use our coins for shops, restaurants, and other services we plan to have.

You can really think of the HPay or the Himalaya payment application as a mobile wallet designed for crypto transactions in the real world.

And then another future thing to look forward to is the Himalaya Exchange on iOS and Android. So we will be launching the phone app soon as well. It is scheduled to be released next in our roadmap at some point this year.

Lastly, in the future what I would like to talk about now is really the Himalaya Ecosystem. We are actively seeking to expand this ecosystem with merchants. This is going to allow our users to spend HCN anywhere they choose in this ecosystem.

One more point I’d like to make about the ecosystem is that we really invested heavily in point-of-sale systems (POS) as well as our data centers around the world. So our infrastructure is solid and is designed for these cross-border global payments.

**What is the difference between Himalaya Dollar and Himalaya Coin? Why does Himalaya Exchange issue two tokens instead of one?**

Jesse: Let’s look at why we have two coins to start. This is a new, burgeoning economy, the crypto economy. But there is still a lot of volatility with it and there is still a lot of risks. So we developed two coins to help protect us against that.

The Himalaya Dollar, which is backed by US Dollar, one-to-one, is designed as a stablecoin, which will help investors or customers in these volatile times. It is a safe haven to exit or enter some of these trades.

The Himalaya Coin, or HCN, is our utility token. It really enables convenient and scalable payments-focused cryptocurrency for our platform. And it is something our users can use in their everyday lives.

**What’s the progress of the first issuance of Himalaya Coin? Will Himalaya Exchange issue further HCN in the future?**

Jesse: As I mentioned before, the issuance is tremendous, it was a huge demand for the Himalaya Coin initially.  All HCN has been allocated but we are still receiving a lot of responses from other potential investors who are interested in purchasing HCN.

Regarding future issuance, to facilitate the potential growth of demand, we might launch subsequent HCN issuances in the future but there will be a cap each year to preserve the market demand of HCN and to support its value appreciation.

**What functions will be available on the Himalaya Exchange trading platform?**

Jesse: To start, there will be a Top-Up function where users will deposit cash or crypto into their Himalaya account to purchase credits.

And with these HDO credits, users will be able to Buy other crypto credits as well, including HCN, ETH, BTC, and other Approved Virtual Assets that will be added and listed in the exchange in the future.

And other functions, I talk about conversion. With these credits on the platform, you will be able to convert bitcoin to Ethereum. You will be able to convert almost all of our pairs as they are rolling out. So we look forward to that. We look forward to having a robust exchange with quite a few pairs in the future.

And of course Withdrawal: users will be able to withdraw or transfer cash or their crypto to any whitelisted addresses they have left on the platform.

And then also one last thing I’d like to mention is the H-Pay App. You will also be able to transfer assets to any whitelisted address using the H-Pay App as well.

**What is Whitelisting?**

Jesse: Well we really want to be on the leading edge of compliance in this constantly evolving regulatory landscape. So that is why have whitelisting.

So really the purpose of implementing the Whitelisting is so that any Himalaya Coin or Himalaya Dollar received by a registered address will not be subjected to a Restricted Period.

Now, you may say, Restricted Period, what is that? Well, don’t be too scared there. The purpose of us putting in this restricted period for whitelisting is to protect against potential liability. It gives users time to act on any fraudulent transactions they may have. And it is really to ensure we have digital asset compliance across all the multiple jurisdictions that we are working in.

(Restriction period: a revolutionary time-lock feature restricting transfers of Himalaya Coin and Himalaya Dollar from any non-whitelisted Ethereum address for a period of 366 days from the date and time it was received unless the relevant Ethereum address has been verified and “whitelisted”)

**For crypto new starters, will they be able to get on the trading platform easily?**

Jesse: Yes, they will. They will be very easy to use the application because they really have an intuitive and simple user interface.

It is really simple for users to come in and top up their accounts and get their HDO credits on the platform.

And then in another way, we really make it simple for early adopters to crypto or first-time users is that we have 24/7/365 support.

So there is always a live person to help you if you need assistance. I really think this is an area where we excel as a company and it’s a differentiator from other exchanges.

We will publish blogs and some other articles, how-to content, video tutorials, and some industry insights and really educate and inform our users as well. I think that is another way for people to understand the marketplace.

And we are really spending a lot of time growing our communities and encouraging discussions and exchange of knowledge.

You know, the community is the driving force of digital asset adoption and we, at Himalaya Exchange, value our community immensely.

And so I think the best advice you could give someone getting into this marketplace is to do your own research, use these articles as information we are putting out, get to understand the marketplace in general. And I think that is the best advice I could give for that.

**When are we expecting the launch of the Exchange and the Himalaya Pay App?**

Jesse: Yes. Barring any unforeseen events, we are expecting to launch the Himalaya Exchange at the end of this month, October.

And then the Himalaya Pay app, as I mentioned before, will be released before the end of the year in Q4.

**How does Himalaya Exchange see itself in the Crypto market? Do you see any upcoming challenges or opportunities?**

Jesse: We see ourselves as leaders in the space with very unique financial products.

Certainly, there are challenges, with regulatory. But we are very proactive with our regulatory strategies and we have large teams of legal counsels spread around the globe helping us in this regard.

You know we also have some early challenges with some of our partners due to the tremendous demand from the private placement. But we managed to find solutions to those challenges and we ended up onboarding over 10000 people as I mentioned before.

For the industry as a whole, there are obviously challenges for the lack of adoption in daily purchases and people’s everyday lives. So that is certainly a challenge that we are looking to provide a solution for the industry.

And we are very confident in our products. There are strong demands. HCN is oversubscribed in the pre-launched period. We are very confident that the demand will be persistent in the future as well.

The sale of our HDO credits largely exceeds the issuance of the HCN allocation. So I think that is a true parameter of the demand that we have right now. So I am very happy about that.

And then again with the regulatory scrutiny that seems to be around the globe now for these products, as I mentioned before we have dedicated a lot of resources to compliance and regulatory teams. So I think we are very well positioned in the space to deal with this very fluid marketplace.

And then lastly, you know our ecosystem, we have talked about it quite a bit. We are investing a lot into it. We are very confident that we are going to be onboarding major brands, commercial merchants in the future to join our ecosystem and that people from all around the globe will be able to use HCN as a utility token to buy products and services. So I am very confident that as we roll that out, our ecosystem will scale.

**Additional Questions from Fans**

**Will crypto loans and margin/futures trading be available on Himalaya Exchange?**

Jesse: Certainly, we are looking at these products. We are analyzing the compliance and regulatory side on that, what that means if we start to roll products like these out. But they are definitely on the roadmap. We are discussing them every day. Hopefully, in the future, I can make more concrete announcements about that.

**Will there be other cryptocurrencies that are popular on the other exchanges be added to the Himalaya Exchange? What do you think will be added?**

Jesse: There will be other coins added in the future. Obviously, we are going to be rolling out Bitcoin and Ethereum. We have what we call Approved Virtual Assets that we all discuss internally as a team. Once we decided to add certain pairs, they will be rolled out. I would think that we will have a broad depth of various coins added to the exchange in the coming months. Our hope is to be a very robust platform with a lot of different coins listed in the future.

**Does Himalaya Exchange have a cold wallet?**

Jesse: Yes. To elaborate a little bit on that, we use a third-party provider called Bitgo which handles our custody but as far as the cold wallet goes, yes, about 95% of all of our funds are stored in the cold wallet. For security, we require multiple signatures from multiple locations or (whitelisted) entities to verify and to move any of these funds into the warm wallet. So we feel like we are very secure. This architecture is a lot of what the major institutional banks are using as well. So we feel like we are at the cutting edge of our industry from a compliance standpoint with that.

**When will customers from Canada, Japan, and the US be able to do KYC?**

Jesse: We are working very diligently to get the proper licensing that is required to set up shop in these countries. To put a timeline on it, it is a little bit difficult. I believe what we are pursuing in the US is looking like somewhere between 12-15 months possibly. In Canada and Japan, I believe the timeline is similar to that, although it may be a little bit shorter. But we understand that these are very big markets, these are markets we want to be in. We just want to make sure, when we enter these markets, we are doing it from a compliance standpoint, something that is regulated and accepted in these countries. We are going through different strategies and what the best approach will be, but I would say that a year or a year and a half out would be timelines we could reach on that.
