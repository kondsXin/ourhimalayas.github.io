我说世界在三到五年内得癌症的（因疫苗的）和因疫苗死亡的，对人类的影响绝对就像当年恐龙灭绝时候那么大，这不是开半点玩笑的。

兄弟姐妹们，可以再次重申，你没有打疫苗有多么的伟大，绝对是你自己一生中最正确的决定。

When I say that the COVID vaccines will result in cancer and death worldwide within three to five years, its impact on humanity will be as great as the extinction of the dinosaurs. This is not a joke at all.

Fellow brothers and sisters, I would like to reiterate again how great it is that you are not vaccinated.

You have certainly made the best decision of your life.

即使打了两针，你吃青蒿素、伊维菌素一定会帮你干掉（疫苗病毒）；

伊维菌素现在能证明，真的几乎是百分之百的管用，只是管用到什么程度；

青蒿素百分之百管用，只要吃对药，伊维菌素、青蒿素绝对能铲除疫苗，一定要传播，而且绝对能救你的命。

Even though some people have been double-vaccinated, artemisinin and ivermectin will help to kill the poisonous substances stored in your body after the vaccination.

It has now been proved that ivermectin is almost 100 percent effective in dealing with the symptoms caused by the vaccines, however differing in its levels of effectiveness depending on the severity of the symptoms. Artemisinin works to treat people with vaccines 100 percent of the time, if you take the right medicine. Both ivermectin and artemisinin can eradicate the poisonous effects of the vaccines, and this information must be spread widely as it can save people’s life.
