President Zelensky said in an interview with Russian media on the 27th that “neutralization” of Ukraine must be guaranteed by a third party and voted on by citizens. He also said that he “rejects” Russia’s demand for “demilitarization”.

Russian regulators warned Russian media not to report that interview.  The exact reason was not revealed, according to Reuters.

Meanwhile, the (US) government officials were pressed about US President Biden’s criticism of Russian President Putin’s “no longer in power” comments.

On the 27th, Secretary of State Blinken emphasized, “We do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia or anywhere else, for that matter. In this case, as in any case, it’s up to the people of the country in question. It’s up to the Russian people.”
