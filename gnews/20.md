锁链女这个背后的故事
The story behind this Chained Girl

引发了江（泽民）、胡（锦涛）包括现在和习之间的这种到底谁该负责
It has evoked such this matter of who should be responsible for this (Chained Girl incident) among Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao and the current Xi Jinping

然后党内对这个事情已经成政治了
and then this matter within the (communist) party has become a political issue

说这事你凭什么找习近平负责？
saying that why do you hold Xi Jinping to be responsible for it?

都是江、胡干的
It was done by Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao

那江、胡时代的官员没人敢说话呀
None of the officials in the Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao eras dared to speak up

实际上下边是不服的。
In fact, the officials under them were dissatisfied

说那个地方每年死掉大概在40到60个人，就无名女尸
There are about 40 to 60 female died in that place (same place as the Chained Girl) every year who are unidentified female corpse

查了一下过去大概30年
I have checked the record in the past 30 years

那个地方死掉的无名女尸达几千具尸体，近万人
and the number of unidentified female corpses that died in that place reached thousands, nearly 10,000

说这些人平均年龄15岁到17岁
the average age of these female was 15 to 17 years old

这吓人吧？这吓人吧？
Isn’t that scary?

然后你再看这种事情没人报道
Then you consider again there has no one reported this kind of thing

我最早在2017年说过
I have said as early as 2017

我去宁夏、我去西藏，还有黄河（边）上
I went to Ningxia, Tibet, and the Yellow River side

当地人说我们就是打捞尸体的
Those locals claimed that their job is salvaging the bodies

我说还有打捞尸体这活儿？
I said there is still have this as a job?

他说每年（河里）都有这个尸体，而且都是年轻人
He said that there are corpses in the river every year, and they are all young people

记得我这一段吧？曾经直播过
Do you remember this part? Which I had have live broadcasted

就中国人
As far as the Chinese are concerned

这种人（被）扔到——像小福利、微蓝，是吧？像你神奇四侠
people like Little Benefit, Weilan and Fantastic Four

给你扔到河里边去你就是个尸体
if you were tossed into the river you were a corpse

你再漂亮也没用
no matter how beautiful you are it would be useless

咱见太多了
We have seen too much of it

悲哀的事情是它没人听啊
However the sad thing is that there is no one wants to listen

原视频标题:
锁链女的事件引发争论，担责的应该是谁，是江泽民、胡锦涛还是现在的习近平，这在中共内部已成为政治事件。其实这种拐卖妇女儿童，导致她们残疾、惨死、甚至消失得无影无踪的事件，在中共国已经由来已久，时常发生，毫不新鲜，中共政府根本无人无暇关心过问。The Chained Girl incident has sparked debate over who should be held responsible, Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao or the current Xi Jinping. This has become a political matter within the CCP. In fact, this kind of abduction and trafficking of women and children, resulting in their disability, tragic death, or even disappearance without a trace, has been around for a long time in China, and it happens frequently. No one cares at all for this matter in the Chinese government.
