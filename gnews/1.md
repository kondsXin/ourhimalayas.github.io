Editor’s note: The author, a volunteer of the New Federal State of China (NFSC)’s International Humanitarian Relief Center in Medyka, Poland, sent back a very touching message reflecting the simplicity and kindness of Ukrainian refugees.

On March 14 in Poland, a little boy came to me. He and his mother were very moved after receiving our help. They took the phone to type the following text with a translator (see picture: Thank you for helping us, you are the hero).

After watching it, I felt extremely proud. He asked where we were from, and I said we were from the New Federal State of China. He may not know the meaning of it, but I understand him repeating “Chinese” many times and showing a thumbs up. His mother even asked me for contact information!

That’s how friends are made, with love. I asked the boy’s mother and they were more than willing to post this picture of me with the boy on the internet.

May the war between Russia and Ukraine end soon, the Ukrainian people return to their homeland soon, and fill the world with love!
