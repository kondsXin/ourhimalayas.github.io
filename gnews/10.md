The analysis was performed with bright field and phase-contrast microscopy and applying rigorous scientific and hygiene standards. Two samples were analyzed from the same vial. These are the results:

该分析是用明视野和相差显微镜进行的，并应用了严格的科学和卫生标准。
对同一小瓶中的两个样品进行了分析。以下为分析结果：

Focusing on the border of the drop (yellow arrow) reveals tiny particles of different sizes and light refraction properties:

聚焦在水滴的边界（黄色箭头），可以看到不同大小和光折射特性的微小颗粒:

Zooming in, the larger particles were found to have a diameter of about 1 µm. For comparison, Diameter of a human hair: 70-90 µm:
放大后，发现较大的颗粒的直径约为1微米。相比较来说，人类头发的直径为70-90 µm:

The smaller particles are about 0.5 µm (= 500 nm) in diameter:

较小的颗粒直径约为0.5微米（=500纳米）:

Some particle aggregations were also visible in the liquid:
在液体中也可以看到一些颗粒的聚集:

Fiber-like structures can also be seen. Their diameter is in the nm-range. (Remember, a human hair has a diameter of about 70-90 µm). Some of them look like a continuous fiber (a, c), some have branches (b, d):
还可以看到纤维状结构，它们的直径在纳米范围内(人类头发的直径约为70-90微米）。其中一些看起来像连续的纤维（a，c），一些有分支（b，d）:

More fiber-like structures. A ring-like structure was seen once (d):
更多的纤维状结构。在（d）图可以看到一个环状结构（d）:

A futher class of particles: comparatively large and with unique light refraction properties. They come in different shapes (e.g rod-like, squares):
另一类颗粒体积相对较大，具有独特的光折射特性。它们有不同的形状（如棒状、方块状）:

More of these objects:
更多此类物体的图片：

And more:
更多此类物体的图片（继续）:

A few unusually shaped objects were found, e.g. a 45 µm long ribbed structure (b) and a particle of about 10 µm in diameter with some “spikes” attached (d):
镜下还发现了一些形状异常的物体，例如，一个45微米长的带状结构（b）和一个直径约为10微米的颗粒，上面附着一些 “尖刺”（d）:

Parts of the liquid crystallized after about 15 min. Encapsulated areas can be seen with crystallized objects of different sizes inside. It’s almost beautiful:
部分液体在大约15分钟后结晶，可以看到封装的区域内有不同大小的结晶物。很漂亮:

Sometimes, these encapsulated crystallized areas (white arrow) contained objects with different light refraction properties to the particles surounding them (yellow arrow):
这些封装的结晶区域（白色箭头）含有与周围的颗粒（黄色箭头）具有不同光折射特性的物体:

Oval-shaped encapsulated crystallized structures can be seen:
镜下还可以看到椭圆形封装的结晶化结构:
![](https://assets.gnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/13.jpg)
These oval-shaped encapsulated crystallized structures have complex internal sub-structures with compartmentalization and particles of different sizes:
这些椭圆形的封装结晶结构具有复杂的内部子结构，具有分室和不同大小的颗粒：

One oval-shaped encapsulated crystallized structure was found attached to a fiber-like object (yellow arrow) with a diameter of about 10 µm:
一个椭圆形封装的结晶结构附着在一个直径约为10微米的纤维状物体上（黄色箭头）:

**Conclusions (1):**

- The Pfizer-BioNTech #Covidvaccine contains particles and objects of different sizes, shapes and light refraction properties


- Complex aggregates and crystallization of these particles and objects were found


**Conclusions (2):**

- The nature (chemical properties, elemental composition) of these particles and objects is unknown


- Careful interpretation of these images is required


- The objects could simply be the ingredients of the vaccine – or contaminants


**Conclusions (3):**

- There is an urgent need to further investigate the ingredients and purity of the #CovidVaccines


**结论（1）**：

- 辉瑞-生物技术公司的COVID疫苗含有不同大小、形状和光折射特性的颗粒和物体


- 发现这些颗粒和物体有复杂的聚集和结晶现象


**结论（2）**：

- 这些颗粒和物体的性质（化学性质、元素组成）是未知的


- 需要对这些图像进行仔细的解释


- 这些物体可能只是疫苗的成分,也可能是污染物


**结论（3）**：

- 迫切需要进一步调查COVID疫苗的成分和纯度
