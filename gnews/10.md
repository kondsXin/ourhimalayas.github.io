 【Narration】
       2022年2月24日，北京奥运会结束后仅四天，俄普京授权俄军在乌克南进行特别行动，无论是从空中，陆地，俄侵略军都有显著的优势，俄乌兵力比是三比一，普大帝妄想着以闪电战，在心里上震慑乌总统及其人民，像2014年侵占克里米亚一样，可以不费吹灰之力，一举拿下乌克南，但是，这一次，普大帝碰上了一个大钉子，甚至可以说被习太阳推进了乌克兰人民战争的沼泽。普京完全没有想到，一个喜剧演员出身的年轻政治素人，乌克兰总统泽连斯基，如此成功的抵抗了他的进攻，并创造了新时代战争的新纪元，定是有上天助佑 ！让我们借助灶王爷上天启禀玉皇大帝的对话，洞悉战争的始末端倪。。。
       灶王爷急急上天庭报告。
 On 2/24/2022, 4 days after the Beijing Winter Olympics, Putin launched a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine.  Russia had the upper hand in the army, navy and air force.  Compared to Ukraine, Russia has 3 times more military strength.  Czar Putin planned to attack Ukraine at rapid speed and frighten President Zelenskyy and its people.  Hoping for the same outcomes of the Crimea invasion in 2014, Putin expected a quick and easy victory over Ukraine.  However, it is different this time.  Czar Putin faced a big challenge. You can almost say that he was pushed into the Ukraine battlefield by Xi.  He never thought that a president with a comedian background could resist Russian attacks successfully and create a new era for themselves. It must be God. Let’s ask Kitchen God to talk to Jade Emperor. From their conversation, we will understand the war completely.
  
   灶王爷：报告玉帝，大事不好，下界除了病毒疫灾，又多了一件祸事：战争
 Kitchen God：Report to Jade Emperor.  It’s not looking good.  Besides pandemics, there is now more trouble in the human world, the war.
 玉帝：交战双方何人？
 Jade Emperor：Who are fighting?
 灶王爷：出兵方曾为共产主义独裁大国苏联，虽以解体，但阴魂不散，有政治强人普大帝，克克勃出身，已执掌大权近十载，反对派奈何不得，国内经济捉襟见肘，但寡头富沃八分，现有实力派共产主义中共国勾接，习太阳以百姓血汗资俄出兵，
 Kitchen God：The one who attacked is communist dictatorship Russia.  Though Russia experienced  dissolution, it never let go of the dream of glorification.  Their president Putin started his career in the KGB.  He holds power for 10 years. Russia has a poor economy but its few leaders hold huge fortunes. Putin hooked up with the wealthy CCP.  Xi used money from his people to support the Russian invasion. 
 玉帝：另一方呢？
 Jade Emperor:  How about the other guy.
 灶王爷：抵御方为苏联解体后一临近小国，名乌克兰，此国新任总统泽连斯基，为一民选总统，政治素人，喜剧演员出身，受百姓爱戴，大国入侵，临危不惧，令士兵官员全力抗敌，百姓踊跃入伍，他携妻儿坚守国都，婉拒友邦之庇佑。
 Kitchen God:The one being attacked is a small neighboring country called Ukraine.  Its new president Zalenskyy was voted in.  He was a comedian and not a politician.  People love him.  He was not frightened by the invasion.  He told people to fight.  Many joined the military enthusiastically.  He and his wife stayed in the capital. He refused other nations’ escape plans.
 玉帝：此等下界英才，几百年难得一出，他乃正义一方，必胜！
 Jade Emperor:Such a nice leader. You can’t find one like him in a hundred years.  He represents justice.  Definitely will win.
 灶王爷：微臣不解，人间的战乱灾祸，少有弱势者获正义，上天也扶不起烂泥，缘何小国可以胜过大国，弱势胜过强力？
 Kitchen God： I don’t understand. There are wars and disasters.  The minority rarely wins justice.  God can’t help people who can’t help themselves. Why can a small nation win over a large nation?  And the weaker one wins over the strong one.
 玉帝：你不懂，泽并不弱，现代战争，打的不是兵力和传统武器，打的是社交媒体，人工智能武器还有数字货币。
Jade Emperor：You don’t understand. Zelenskyy is not weak.  Current war focuses on social media, weapons with artificial intelligence and digital currency. It doesn’t focus on traditional weapons or military strength.  
 灶王爷：小臣懂了，报告完毕，就此退下
 Kitchen God：I got it. Report successfully.  Allow me to leave.

 字幕：This must be bless by God.
 一定有上天护佑！

  
 " I think : everyone who access in support of Ukraine, in support freedom. But the war continues. The access of terror against peaceful people go on. One month already that longer. It breaks my heart. Heart's of all Ukraine's. Every free person on planet."
 中文：
 "我想：每个人都支持乌克兰，支持自由，但战争仍在继续。 对和平人民的恐怖袭击仍在继续。 一个月已经很长了。 它伤了我的心，伤了所有乌克兰人的心，伤了地球上的每一个自由人的心。"
