郭文贵
Miles Guo

如果你们真知道爆料革命的十亿分之一的力量
If you really know one-billionth of the power of the whistleblower movement

你觉得你曾经过去几年来说的话、做的事儿
for everything you have said and done in the past few year

你都觉得是个傻子
you would feel you are a fool

我今年2022年, 我在大直播中第一句话
My first sentence in the big live broadcast this year 2022

我深思熟虑地告诉大家
I will tell everyone thoughtfully

如果你们真地觉得你们在爆料革命当中，你都懂了
if you really think that you understand all in the midst of the whistleblower movement

我可以告诉你，你连懂十亿分之一你都是个傻子
I can tell you that you would be a fool even you think you understand one billionth of it

明年你再看去年发生的事
You can look back next year to see what had happened last year

你觉得你就是个（傻子）, 真的觉得自己不好意思
You will feel that you are a fool, and it’s really embarrassed

我给你举个最简单的例子
Let me give you a simple example

盖特，我要在三个月以前跟你说盖特发生这样的事，
Gettr, if I told you three months ago that something like this happened to Gettr

你一定觉得我放狗屁
you would definitely think I’m bullshiting

我告诉你某银行行长跟我说句话
I’ll tell you that the director of an individual bank had a word with me

七哥，你信不信
(The bank director said), Brother Seven (Miles Guo), do you believe that?

我们就刚刚在俄罗斯回来
We just came back from Russia

我在俄罗斯的会上
I was in the meeting in Russia

所有人都严肃认真地开会
where everyone took the meeting seriously

歌颂习太阳
and they were praising Xi Jinping

习太阳和普京总统的个人关系改变了世界
and saying that the personal relationship of Xi and Putin has changed the world

大家都是鼓完掌以后，一下来，他说，走到这个走廊里
Everyone came down after applauding and walking into this corridor

你知道你们没去过红场
You know you haven’t been to Red Square

红宫的外交的这个神秘走廊，是绝对安全的啊
This mysterious corridor of diplomacy in the Red Palace is absolutely safe

他说，你知道那个厢廊里边，所有人谈的是什么？
He said, you know what everyone is talking about in that corridor?

郭文贵、爆料革命、新中国联邦、喜联储，喜币
It’s about Guo Wengui, whistleblower movement, New Federal State of China, Himalaya Federal Reserve, and HCoin

还有这个家伙会唱歌
There was a guy who can sing

竟然这个俄罗斯人竟然当场点出来歌来放
This Russian guy actually picked out a song (Miles Guo’s song) on the spot to play

所有人都吓得，把中方人都吓懵了
Everyone was scared, and frightened those Chinese officials

这个时候，他说，出现了一个滑稽般的笑话
At that time, there was a ridiculous joke

他说普京突然转过来了
He said that Putin suddenly turned around

哎哎哎，你们能不能别在这儿放这个歌？
hey hey, can you guys stop playing this song here?

别在这放这个歌，然后哈哈大笑，他走了
Don’t play this song here, then laugh out loud and left

我说这个你们觉得，我要我在三年前说
I’m telling this, but if I told you these three years ago

你们觉得唐平、郭文贵就是个骗子，是吧？
you would have thought that Tang Ping and Guo Wengui are liars, right?

那就是神经病
That would be crazy

但是你看，在这种世界的最关键的场合里边
But you see, in the most critical occasions of this world

有人在谈论而且把它当成不是笑话，当成一个大家可期待的
there are people talking about it and not treating it as a joke, instead, as something that everyone can look forward to

然后你看到几个银行, 我要说这几个
And then you see a few banks which I’m going to say

五大银行会以这个以“7”为主题
The five major banks will take the “7” as the theme

你会说我胡说八道
You would say I’m nonsense

什么时候定的？
When was this set?

我告诉大家10月1号定的方案
I’ll tell you that it was the plan set on October 1st

我向全中国人说
I’ll say it to all the Chinese people

你问问所有人是不是10月1号定的方案
You can go ask everyone if it is the plan made on October 1st

而且10月1号跟咱音乐啥关系? 大家去想想去吧
And what does October 1st relate with our music? Go think about it.

这叫天意。
This is called providence
