On March 21st, China Evergrande, Evergrande Motors and Evergrande Properties once again suspended trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. This is not the first time Evergrande has suspended its stock trading. As early as September 16th last year upon its stock tumbling, Evergrande suspended the trading on nine of its bonds on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. Evergrande also suspended trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on January 3rd this year. What followed was another tragedy that Hong Kong stocks fell below 20,000 points from the beginning of the year until March 14th and fell to 18,000 points.

After Miles Guo exposed the drastic impact of what below-20,000 points meant, the CCP frantically reversed the decline of Hong Kong stocks despite the negative information that many real estate companies such as Evergrande and Yango Group were unable to repay their debts and were taken over by state-owned enterprises of Communist China. Miles Guo emphasized in a March 21st Gettr video that one of the next two things the fellow fighters of the New Federal State of China need to pay attention to is what will happen in a few months — the drastic crash of the CCP’s real estate market, and the collapse of the economy in Communist China and Hong Kong.
