**郭文贵**
**Miles Guo**

我真的从小坚信一句话，我只要坚持持之以恒我就不相信(有)磕不下来的事
I’ve truly believed in a word since I was a child, as long as I persist in it, I don’t believe in things that can’t be done

你们没想到七哥讲英文有多难，我40年我没把英文学会
You didn’t expect how difficult it is for me to speak English, in 40 years I ha-ven’t learned English well

而且我身边全是讲英文的，我这一生最失败的就是英文
and all around me are English speakers, the most failed thing in my life is Eng-lish

语言没学好，但是从爆料革命开始创建了郭氏英文
I didn’t learn the language well, but since starting the whistleblower movement that I created Guo’s style English

你看看我用郭氏英文被这个Isobel Yeung采访的时候，现在响遍全中国
Look at me what I used this Guo’s style English when I was interviewed by Iso-bel Yeung, now it’s resounding all over China

哇塞，我的老师说第二个文贵你的英文太好了，我竟然全听懂了
Wow, my teacher said the second one, Miles, your English was so good, I actual-ly understand it all

哈哈，我说老师，你这话真的说得太夸张了，
Haha, I said “teacher, what you said is really exaggerated

你听懂了对我来讲，是讲得好还是不好，是不是
you understand what I said, is it good or bad?”

说明我讲得很不好嘛，我讲好英文，你是听不懂的，因为你的英文很差，是吧
That means that I speak very badly, I speak English well, but you can’t under-stand it because your English is not good, right?

她都听懂了，说明我讲得很差，还要把英文拿下来，你讲讲试试
She understands everything, It means that I speak poorly, I still have to work hard on my English, give it a try

神奇四侠，你的西班牙英文咋样，英文你给我秀秀
Fantastic Four, how do you speak Spanish and English? Show me some yours

西枫，你讲讲英文，顺利的英文，是不是? 虽然你是秘翻组
Xifeng, you speak English and are fluent in English, right? although you are in the secret translation group

不容易，持之以恒
it is not easy, it needs perseverance

灭共这件事，就关键你信不信，关键你干不干到底
Believe it or not is the key point for you to taking down the CCP, the key point is whether you can persist do it or not

某将军在私下里边，跟刘亚洲，已经被抓了，说那小子，记得吗
In privately, there is a general talked to Liu Yazhou who had been arrested, he said do you remember that guy（Miles Guo）?

咱们一起吃过饭的，在外面折腾那么大，又建国又建邦的
We have eaten together, and he（Miles Guo） made big noise abroad, also set up the nation and the federal state

所有的五六个人，唰，全都停下来(夹)菜，没有一个人接这个茬的
All five or six people suddenly all stopped talking and started picking the dish-es, no one want to continue this topic

这哥们儿喝多了，刚才我还没问你呢，亚洲
This buddy drank too much, “I didn’t ask you just now, Yazhou

你怎么看那个人，哈哈，刘亚洲想想说，你他妈吃饱了撑的，是不是，喝多了吧
What do you think of that person（Miles Guo）, haha, Liu Yazhou think about it and said that you damn eat too much, don’t you, drink too much?

你提他干什么呀，说你提都不敢提，说明你很怕这件事
Why are you mentioning him?” you dare not mention it, it shows that you are very afraid of it

结果刘亚洲说了句特别精彩的话，说咱一屋子的人全是带星的
As a result, Liu Yazhou said something particularly wonderful, saying that all the people in this room are all with stars （military rank）

我们敢提任何人，都不敢提他，你说我是啥观点，然后说，喝酒
“We can mention anyone, we do not dare to mention him, you say what my opinion is” and then say let’s drink

这就是当时的刘亚洲，因为那时没抓呢， 我就不好意思说
This was Liu Yazhou at that time, because he hasn’t arrested at that time, I’m a little hesitant to mention him
