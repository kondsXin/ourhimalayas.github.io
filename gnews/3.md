对共产党最大的叫经济核弹，就是停止你使用美元
The biggest US weapon against the communists is called economic nukes, which is to stop you from using the dollar

对待伊朗，所有的什么这些国家，巴基斯坦
in Iran, Pakistan, and all of whatever these countries

现在变成了，美国人怕共产党停止美元支付
Now it has become that the U.S. is worried Communist China would Stop Using the dollar payment

为什么？
Why?

共产党说我不接受任何美元支付的时候
When the Communist Party says I’m not accepting any dollar payments

不是人民币跌了，是人民币会暴涨
It’s not that the yuan would go down, it would skyrocket

美元会暴跌，美股会暴跌
The dollar would drop and the U.S. stock market would collapse

这是为什么共产党牛啊
This is why the communist party is evil

5000亿给沙特，搞了一个投资2万亿美元
They offer 500 billion dollars to Saudi Arabia, and have made a 2 trillion dollars investment

然后未来20年全接受数字人民币和人民币结算
and then Saudi Arabia would accept digital yuan and yuan settlement for the next 20 years

美国当年创建阿美集团呐
That’s the U.S. that created Aramco back then

帮着沙特挖出了油啊
US helped the Saudis dig out the oil

那个地方只有沙子，什么都没有
There was nothing but sand back then

当年的国王看着油出来的时候浑身发抖
The king was trembling when he saw the oil came out

就抖的不行了，就抖
He was shaking so much that he couldn’t stand it

当年他才30几个媳妇，出来油以后就变成了5000个媳妇
He only had about 30 wives back then, but it became 5000 after the oil came out

5000个王子，500个媳妇
Actually, it was 5000 princes, 500 wives

最后发现美国人骗他以后，把阿美给强行国有化收回来
Finally, after finding out that the Americans had cheated him, he nationalized Aramco and took it back

沙特王国诞生
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was born

后来美国人签了个合同
Afterward, the Americans signed a contract with Saudi Arabia

好吧，壳牌石油，我以后买我就最便宜的
All right, Shell Oil, our America will pay the lowest price when buying it in the future

几美金一桶的油
A few dollars a barrel

这是美国的石油技术
This is thanks to the United States oil technology

后来美国发展页岩气才出来的
Later, the United States developed shale gas

要不然美国这个油就被卡住了
Otherwise, the United States would be stuck with oil

但是，现在美国搞了个什么
But now, what U.S. want to do with China?

整个在沙特当年干的事情，它想在中国搞一个
The whole thing that the US did to Saudi Arabia back then, they want to repeat it again in China

经济上的像阿美的
which is creating an economic puppet-like Aramco

结果人家不是给你收回来了，是连你都给废了
As a result, the CCP not only took back this economic puppet but also want to destroy the United States

这时候澳大利亚、日本为啥要出汗，你知道吗？
At this time, do you know why Australia and Japan are sweating?

日本紧张啊
Japan is being nervous

共产党要在亚洲当老大，这已经是亚洲老大了
The Communist Party wants to be the boss in Asia, which he already is

美国也承认了你是我代言人
The United States has also recognized The Communist Party as their spokesman

过去30年，八九六四之后
In the past 30 years, after June 4, 1989 (the Tiananmen massacre)

基辛格、克林顿、布什家族已经全同意
Kissinger, Clinton, and Bush family had all agreed

这都是明摆的事
This is obvious

日本现在你看我跟你那么好
Japan told the United States that we were having such a good relationship

我想当亚洲老大
let me be the boss of Asia

所以叫CPTPP，是吧？
So they organized the CPTPP, right?

全面与进步跨太平洋伙伴关系协定
They made the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement

那可是日本绝对的经济杀手锏
That was Japan’s absolute economic killer

结果被川普给废掉了
however, it was scrapped by Trump
