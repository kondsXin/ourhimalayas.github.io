with the nations of Europe and the world

与欧洲和世界各国合作

Ukraine can not and will not agree with the passive sanction position of some entities towards Russia

乌克兰不能也不会同意某些实体对俄罗斯采取的消极制裁立场

there should be no “suspended” sanction packages that if the Russian troops do something then there will be some answers…

不应该有 “暂停 “的一揽子制裁措施，诸如如果俄军做了什么（退让）就会有一些回应…

We went through the story last year when we said that strong preventive sanctions against Russia were needed to prevent an invasion

去年我们说需要对俄罗斯进行强有力的预防性制裁以防止入侵时，我们已经经历了这个过程

The preventive package was not made

预防性的制裁还未做成

A full-scale war has begun

There are now many hints and warnings that sanctions will be tightened,

现在有许多暗示和警告，制裁将被加强

such as an embargo on Russia oil supplies to Europe if Russia uses chemical weapons.

例如，如果俄罗斯使用化学武器，将对俄罗斯输欧的石油供应进行禁运

There are simply no words.

简直无话可说

Just think about what it all came down to.

想想这会导致怎样的后果

Waiting for chemical weapons…we, living people, have to wait…

等着化学武器的使用……我们这些活生生的人，只能在这等着……

Doesn’t everything that the Russian military is doing and has already done deserve an oil embargo?

难道俄罗斯军方正在做的和已经犯下的一切还不够世界对其实行石油禁运吗？

Don’t phosphorus bombs deserve that?

甚至使用磷弹也不足够？

Do the shelled chemical production or nuclear power plant deserve that?

炮击化工厂、核电站，这些都不够吗？

It is important for us that the sanctions packages are effective and substantial enough, given what is already being done against Ukraine by the Russian Federation.

对于俄罗斯联邦在乌克兰的所作所为，制裁措施要足够有效和有实质性。这对我们很重要。

If the sanctions packages are weak or do not work enough, if they can be circumvented, it creates a dangerous illusion for the Russian leadership that they can continue to afford what they are doing now.

如果制裁措施软弱无力或不够有效，如果它们可以被规避，就会给俄罗斯领导人造成一种危险的错觉，即他们可以继续承受得起他们现在所做的一切

And Ukrainians pay for it with their lives. Thousands of lives.

而乌克兰人则会付出生命的代价。数以千计的生命

Therefore, starting this week, we are creating a group of experts at the President’s office- Ukrainian and International, who will constantly analyze the sanctions against Russia-what they really influence.

因此，从本周开始，我们将在总统办公室设立一个由乌克兰人和国际专家组成的小组，他们将不断分析对俄罗斯的制裁-真正影响的是什么

Our goal is for the sanctions to work as intended.

我们的目标是让制裁按照预期发挥作用

And so that there is no possibility to circumvent them.

这样就不存在规避制裁的可能性

This must be a goal for the whole democratic world,

这必须成为整个民主世界的一个目标

without exception, No exception.

毫无例外，没有例外

During the week I will speak in the parliaments of the partner countries: Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Greece, Australia.

在这一周里，我将在伙伴国的议会中发表演讲：丹麦、挪威、荷兰、希腊、澳大利亚

It is important that these are speeches not only in front of politicians, but also in societies.

重要的是，这些演讲不仅是在政治家面前，而且是在社会大众面前

In front of millions of people who want to hear Ukraine and are ready to hear it to help and support. Who feel that we are fighting for our common freedom.one for all people on our earth.

在数百万人们面前。他们想听到乌克兰的声音，并准备来帮助和支持我们，他们知道我们在为我们共同的自由而战，我们是在为地球上的所有人而战。

I will emphasize everywhere that no one has the right to use the lives of Ukrainians to save any income in Russia or income common with Russia.

我会到处强调，没有人有权利用乌克兰人的生命来挽救俄罗斯的任何收入或与俄罗斯共同的收入

And Ukrainians should not die just because someone can not find

enough courage to hand over the necessary weapons to Ukraine.

乌克兰人不应该因为某些人没有足够的勇气把必要的武器交给乌克兰而失去生命

Fear always makes you an accomplice.

恐惧总是让你成为帮凶

If someone is afraid of Russia, if he or she is afraid to make the necessary decisions that are important to us, in particular for us to get planes, tanks, necessary artillery, shells,

如果有人惧怕俄罗斯，如果他们不敢做出对我们很重要的必要决定，特别是不敢让我们获得飞机、坦克、必要的火炮、炮弹

It makes these people responsible for the catastrophe of the Russian troops in our cities, too.

那么这些人也要对俄军在我们城市的造成的灾难负责

Because if you could save, you had to save.

因为如果你能拯救，你就必须拯救

The peoples of Europe, the peoples of the world will definitely hear and support me.

欧洲人民，世界人民一定会听到并支持我

And all politicians should think now what they will have left if they don’t correspond to the position of their people.

而所有的政治家现在都应该想想，如果他们不代表人民的立场，他们价值何在

And finally, Already traditional,

最后，按照已经形成的传统

Just before delivering this address to you, dear Ukrainians, I signed two important decrees on awarding servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with state awards, at the request of our Commander-in-chief, 302 of our defenders are awarded.

就在向你们，亲爱的乌克兰人发表这个讲话之前，应我们总司令的要求，我签署了两项关于向乌克兰武装部队军人颁发国家奖励的重要法令。我们有302名卫士受到了嘉奖

I am grateful to all of you for your service!

我对你们所有人的服务表示感谢!

Glory to all our heros!

荣耀属于我们所有的英雄!

Glory to Ukraine!
