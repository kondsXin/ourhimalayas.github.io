卡车事件停止疫苗
The Trucker Convoy Protest to stop the vaccine

全世界冬奥会结束
and the world’s Winter Olympics ended

战争一起
these war are going to happen

你记住, 什么视线都转移不了
Keep in mind that you won’t be able to divert whatever eyesight

你别以为就（只是）经济
Don’t think it’s just the economy

大家都会干一件事儿——（质问）武汉实验室发生了什么！
Everyone will do one thing, which is to question what happened to the Wuhan laboratory!

只要是俄罗斯一开打
As long as Russia starts fighting

习只要一动台湾, 只要一动或者不动台湾
Xi Jinping wars on Taiwan, as long as he starts the war or not

就是乌克兰（被）打了
once Ukraine is attacked

全世界这个就是乌克兰、苏联的事就结束了！
all matters in the world about Ukraine and the Soviet Union (Russia) would be over!

它动，动的开始就是结束，没有任何犹豫的
War on Ukraine, its beginning would be its ending, without any hesitation

不可能苏联把全世界都干掉
It is impossible that letting the Soviet Union (Russia) destroy the whole world

俄罗斯, 一定是把它干掉，只是干掉的代价有多大！
Russia would definitely be taken down, it is just a matter of how big the cost would be

经济大乱套，经济会重整。
The economy would be in chaos, and the economy would recover

不管哪样你说谁是赢家？
Who would you say is the winner anyway?

咱是最大赢家！
We are the biggest winner!

在这种情况下，你说那个时候就直灭共产党
Under such circumstances, (the world) would directly go to the CCP and destroy them

直灭共产党你找他干啥去啊？
Why would they go to the CCP?

说你支持了苏联
say you supported the Soviet Union (Russia)

俄国和美国、澳大利亚这都会站在一起
Russia, Australia, and the United States would all stand together

三件事会发生
Three things would happen

所有的向左这种极端政权（强推）打疫苗的，每个人都会上绞刑架
(First) all the extreme leftist regimes who mandated vaccination would be hanged on the gallows

只要让人家打（毒）疫苗的一定会上绞刑架, 你都想都不用想
As long as you mandated people for vaccination would be executed, no excuse

那么五月份以后这些官员上绞刑架了
Then after these officials were hanged on the gallows and the month of May

这个疫苗（导致）接下来大量的死亡
this vaccine would lead to a mass of deaths

这些社会的动乱会此起彼伏
and these social turmoils would continue one after another

这个大卡车事件你都会忽视掉
this Trucker Convoy Protest incident would be ignored

因为越死人越多谁能控制得了?
Because who can control when there are more and more people die?

你能受得了吗？
Can you take it?

就西方的文明世界的政治形势和媒体一切
The next step would be everything about the political situation of the Western civilized world and the media

包括医疗部门重新改写
including the rewriting of the medical sector

这就是天机啊！
This is God’s chance!

俄罗斯和乌克兰和中共对台湾的问题
(Second) the issues of Russia and Ukraine, the issue of CCP and Taiwan

（将导致）世界地球上的政治板块彻底改变
would lead to a complete change in the political plate of the world on earth

然后西方的文明运动改变了西方的、资本主义的、所有的、民主的、现在存在的独裁
and then the movement of civilization in the West would change the Western, capitalist, all, democratic, now existing dictatorships

和走向极左方向（的状态）彻底地纠正过来
and the extreme leftist situation would get corrected completely

第三世界经济印了那么多钱
Third, the world economy has printed so much money

现在已经印了快300亿（美元）了有
It has printed nearly 300 trillion US dollars

从过去200、官方226万亿到现在实际上260万亿
From 200 trillion in the past, the official 226 trillion, now the actual 260 trillion

到最近增加（到）将近300万亿美元的印刷的钞票
and recently increased to nearly 300 trillion Trillions of dollars of printed banknotes

都将给你打成泡沫，啥都没有
all these would be blown into a bubble, nothing left

然后世界上两种货币存在，数字货币和法币
Then there would be two currencies that exist in the world, the digital currency and Fiat currency

那咱又是赢家
Then we are the winner again
