So first of all, in July that a local lab in Georgia said they wanted me to examine contents of a vial that they had just received.
首先，在7月，乔治亚州的一个当地实验室说他们希望我检查他们刚刚收到的一瓶疫苗的成分。
And this particular vial was Moderna.
这瓶疫苗是莫德纳。
And so I was there to witness them getting that and putting some of the contents on a glass slide.
所以我在那里见证了他们拿到那瓶疫苗，并把一些成分放在玻璃片上。
First it looked translucent. And then as time went on over 2 hours. Colours appeared which I’ve never seen anything like this. There was a chemical reaction happening. It was a brilliant like blue and royal purple and yellow and sometimes green.
开始，它看起来是半透明的。然后随着时间的推移，超过了2个小时。颜色出现了，我从来没有见过这样的东西。发生了一种化学反应。它是一种灿烂的蓝色、皇家紫色和黄色，有时是绿色。
These fibres were appearing more more. Some of the vials had a little
越来越多纤维出现了。一些疫苗瓶上有一个小的
cube structure on that I’m not sure what that was. Also metallic fragments were in there.
立方体的东西，我不确定那是什么。还有金属碎片在里面。
They were not metallic fragment I’m used to seeing, more exotic, they are very opaque.
它们不是我平时看到的金属碎片，更有异国情调，它们是非常不透明的。
As the edge of the cover slide, so the coverslip, you put a glass partition on that piece on top of the glass slide. There are edges. And so all the particulars
由于玻璃盖片的边缘滑动，玻璃盖片滑落，你在那块玻璃片上面放了一个玻璃隔板。有边缘。于是所有的颗粒物
all these colours started to move to the edge
所有这些有颜色的（颗粒物）都开始向边缘移动，
And there was self-assembling going on. Things are growing.
而且它们有自我组装的情况发生。这些物质在变大。
And then there was one particular, I say object, or organism, I’m not sure what to call it, that
然后有一个特别的东西，我说是物体，或者有机生物，我不确定该怎么称呼它，
had tentacles coming from it. And it was able to lift
有触角从它身上伸出来。它能够把自己撑起来
itself up, off the cover
移到玻璃盖片外
I’m sorry, off the glass slide. It was alive? The thing was alive? It appeared to. Yeah it appeared to have the self-aware or would be able to grow
对不起，是离开玻璃片。 它是活的？那东西是活的？它看起来是的。是的，它似乎有自我意识，或者能够生长
or move in space. Some appear to be self-aware, like it knows we were watching it.
或在空中移动。有些似乎有自我意识，好像它知道我们在看它。
And so you know just recently the lab, I was able to get more vials, same manufacturer but you know different batch, of course. Looking at it the same way into the compound microscope
你知道最近在实验室，我得到更多瓶疫苗，同样的制造商，当然是不同的批次。在复式显微镜下以同样的方式观察它
and another one of those tentacle like structures appeared. This was now completely under the cover slip.
又出现了一个有类似触角的结构的东西。这次它已经完全在玻璃盖片下面了。
So there was no moving because it wasn’t on the edge
所以没有移动，因为它不在边缘上。
But I just couldn’t believe I saw another one
但我难以相信我又看到了一个
