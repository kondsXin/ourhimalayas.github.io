香草山：铭心

4月15日晚上7点半，梅迪卡营地的以色列志愿者们聚集在NFSC帐篷庆祝逾越节，以色列志愿者把NFSC帐篷比作“解放的营地”。以色列志愿者团队为了表示感谢新中国联邦，用英语讲解逾越节的习俗和意义。新中国联邦志愿者为节日备好水煮鸡蛋，代表越战越勇的意思，象征饱受苦难和奴役，但最终成为最坚强民族，为建立了自由家园从未停止，同时也是对新中国联邦人的祝福和支持，消灭中国共产党，建立自由法治家园。

April 15th, 7:30 p.m. Israeli volunteers from the Medyka Rescue Center gathered at the NFSC tent to celebrate Passover, during which the Israeli volunteers have compared the center to a “center of freedom”. The Israeli volunteer team explained the customs and meaning of Passover in English as a token of appreciation to the NFSC. The New Federal State of China’s volunteers prepared boiled eggs for the holiday, representing the more they fight the more courageous they become. This symbolizes the people who suffered and were enslaved, but eventually became the strongest people who never stopped to build a free homeland. This is also a blessing and support for the New Federal State of China to take down the Chinese Communist Party and build a free homeland under the rule of law.
