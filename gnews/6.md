据《零对冲》记者 Tyler Durden 2021年10月12日报道：**美国债券市场可能已经关闭，但在中国却是全面开放，当地人利用这一事实做了一件事：卖出**。

在我们的病毒式文章《灾难性的房地产销售意味着中国最坏的情况正在发生》之后，**由于恒大将第三次违约（离岸）债券兑付，周一中国房地产公司债券再次遭受重创**，竞争对手**现代置业**则成为最新的争相推迟最后期限的人。

在经历了有史以来最快的跌幅之后，中国垃圾债券市场（房地产开发商发行人占主导地位）再次受到影响，因为人们对这个5 万亿美元行业 —— 驱动着中国经济相当大的一部分 —— 的担忧情绪继续迅速蔓延。与此同时，路透社援引消息人士的话报道称，**中国恒大集团的境外债券持有人在亚洲时间周一截止日期前仍未收到利息支付**。

虽然在恒大的违约现在只是语义上的问题，但**花样年**在表示其流动性良好的几周之后，**却以一个意想不到的公告震惊了它的债券持有人，这导致其债券在几秒钟内从面值暴跌至 74 美分。**

……其他压力迹象包括规模较小的竞争对手**现代置业**要求投资者将 10 月 25 日到期的 2.5 亿美元债券付款推迟三个月，部分是“以避免任何潜在的付款违约”。这出乎意料，**现代置业**2021年4月的债券当天暴跌超过50% 至30美分。

在其他地方，**鑫源房地产**提议**仅支付10月15日到期的票据本金的 5%**，并将该债务换成 2023 年到期的债券。惠誉评级称此举为不良债务交换，同时将公司评级降至 C。至少两家公司的债务规模是相对较小的：根据彭博汇编的数据，现代置地和鑫源的未偿美元债券分别为 13.5 亿美元和 7.6 亿美元。相比之下，恒大拥有192亿美元。

在高收益发行人的跌幅中，中国**奥园集团 **2024 年到期的 6.35% 票据兑美元下跌 13.2美分至 57.5美分；融创 2026年到期、利率为 6.5% 的美元债券下跌 9.4美分至 57.9美分，使两者均收于有史以来的最低水平。

**佳兆业集团**是 2015 年首家违约的中国房地产开发商，其部分债券也暴跌至面值的一半以下，而**富力地产**和**绿地控股**等被认为是“安全”的名称，它们都拥有声誉良好的项目在伦敦等全球城市，也被广泛抛售。

彭博指数显示，中国垃圾美元债券的收益率上周飙升 291个基点，至 17.54%，为 10 年来的最高水平。

**雪上加霜的是，中国 10 年期国债期货跌至三个月低点**，因为央行最近的流动性流失削弱了对新一轮货币政策宽松的预期。10 年期国债期货合约下跌 0.4% 至 99.14，为 7 月 12日以来的最低水平。10 年期主权债券收益率上涨 5 个基点，为两个月来最大涨幅，至2.96%。

**“这是灾难性的一天。”**香港的大道资产管理的固定收益产品经理 Clarence Tam 告诉路透社，强调**即使是一些本应更安全的“投资级”公司现在也看到 20% 的债券被抹去。**“我们认为这是由全球资金外流驱动的……从根本上说，我们担心在岸抵押贷款管理会严重打击开发商的现金流。”他补充说，指的是人们可能会停止为新房支付首付。

换句话说，我们在周末讨论的动态解释了为什么**“中国最坏的情况正在发生”，正在从最大的烂苹果 —— 即恒大、花样年 —— 蔓延到对房地产行业的信心崩溃，再到目前为止被认为是健康和免受房地产内爆影响的信贷。**简而言之，美国房地产泡沫的破灭已经转移到中国，是的 —— 它会像雷曼那样告终。

与此同时，摩根大通分析师强调，国际投资者现在要求以最高溢价购买或持有“垃圾”级中国债券。该银行紧随其后的 JACI 中国高收益指数与投资级 AA 级中国本地市场债券（称为“在岸”债券）的类似指数之间存在高达 1,200 个基点的差异。ICE BofA亚洲美元高收益企业中国发行人指数 (MERACYC) 的期权调整价差也达到有史以来最宽的水平。

摩根大通的分析师表示：**“恒大的蔓延风险现在正在其他发行人和行业蔓延。”**

**虽然今天可能是“灾难性的”，但如果市场对北京将救助债券市场失去信心，情况可能会变得更糟。**

“我们认为政策制定者对出现的系统性风险持零容忍态度，旨在维持房地产市场稳定，如果房地产活动水平恶化，政策支持可能即将到来。”高盛亚洲信贷主管 Kenneth Ho 表示。

一夜之间，我们在东北部黑龙江省省会哈尔滨看到了这种隐性支持的第一个迹象，它成为中国首批宣布支持房地产开发商及其项目的城市之一。据哈尔滨日报运营的网站报道，该市将向符合条件的“人才”提供最高10万元的购房补贴。该市还将向购房者提供更多符合住房公积金贷款条件的现有房屋；文件称，此举旨在促进该市房地产市场平稳健康发展。

摩根士丹利亚洲量化研究主管 Gilbert Wong 表示，虽然中国房地产行业的动荡迄今已被债券市场所遏制，但离岸债券的紧张局势可能很快会给该国的股票交易员带来麻烦。截至周五，彭博汇编的数据显示，可比美国国债的高收益信用利差是有记录以来最大的 —— 经期权调整后约为 1,866 个基点。但本月到目前为止，衡量股票波动性的指标实际上已经下降。

尽管如此，这一对已表现出这些年的密切关系，表明他们的分歧可能不会持续，最终，**成千上万中国居民投资的股票市场崩溃，可能加速将北京从麻木的不救助中唤醒**。



**“It’s A Disastrous Day” – All Hell Breaks Loose In China’s Bond Markets**

BY TYLER DURDEN

TUESDAY, OCT 12, 2021 – 04:11 AM

The US bond market may be closed, but it was fully open in China, and locals took advantage of this fact to do one thing: sell.

In the aftermath of our viral post “”Catastrophic” Property Sales Mean China’s Worst Case Scenario Is Now In Play”, China property firms bonds were hit with another wrecking ball on Monday as Evergrande was set to miss its third round of (offshore) bond payments in as many weeks and rival Modern Land became the latest scrambling to delay deadlines.

Having already suffered the fastest drop on record, Chinese junk bond markets – where property developer issuers dominate – were routed once again as fears about fast-spreading contagion in the $5 trillion sector, which drives a sizable chunk of the Chinese economy, continued to savage sentiment. Meanwhile, China Evergrande Group’s offshore bondholders still had not received interest payment by a Monday deadline Asia time, Reuters reported citing sources.

But while Evergrande’s default is now just semantics, and one week after Fantasia shocked bondholders with a surprise announcement it too would stuff creditors just weeks after it had said its liquidity was fine, which sent its bond plunging from par to 74 cents in seconds…

… other signs of stress included smaller rival Modern Land asking investors to push back by three months a $250 million bond payment due on Oct. 25 in part “to avoid any potential payment default.” This was not expected, and Modern Land’s April 2023 bond plunged more than 50% to 30 cents on the day.

Elsewhere, Xinyuan Real Estate proposed paying just 5% of principal on a note due Oct. 15 and swapping that debt for bonds due 2023. Fitch Ratings called the move a distressed debt exchange while downgrading the firm to C. At least the two companies are relatively small: Modern Land and Xinyuan have $1.35 billion and $760 million of dollar bonds outstanding, respectively, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In comparison, Evergrande has $19.2 billion.

Among the declines for high-yield issuers, China Aoyuan Group’s 6.35% note due 2024 dropped 13.2 cents on the dollar to 57.5 cents; Sunac’s 6.5% dollar bond due 2026 declined 9.4 cents to 57.9 cents, leaving both poised to close at the lowest-ever levels.

Kaisa Group, which was the first Chinese property developer to default back in 2015, also saw some of its bonds slump to less than half their face value while supposedly “safe” names such as R&F Properties, and Greenland Holdings, which both have prestige projects in global cities like London, were also widely sold.

Yields on Chinese junk-rated dollar bonds surged 291 basis points to 17.54% last week, the highest level in about a decade, according to a Bloomberg index.

And just to add insult to injury, China’s10-year government bond futures declined to a three-month low as the central bank’s latest liquidity draining weakened expectations of fresh monetary policy easing. Futures contracts on 10-year notes fall 0.4% to 99.14, the lowest level since July 12. 10-year sovereign bond yields rose 5bps, the biggest gains in two months, to 2.96%.

“It’s a disastrous day,” Clarence Tam, fixed income PM at Avenue Asset Management in Hong Kong, told Reuters, highlighting how even some supposedly safer “investment grade” firms had now seen 20% wiped off their bonds. “We think it’s driven by global fund outflow …. Fundamentally, we are worried the mortgage management onshore hits the developers’ cash flow hard,” he added, referring to concerns people could stop putting deposits down on new homes.

In other words, the dynamic we discussed over the weekend in which we explained why “China’s Worst Case Scenario Is Now In Play” is spreading from the biggest rotten apples – i.e., Evergrande, Fantasia – to collapsing confidence in the property sector, to credits that until now were seen as healthy and immune from a property implosion. In short, the bursting of the US housing bubble has moved to China, and yes – that culminated with the original Lehman moment.

Meanwhile, JPMorgan analysts highlighted how international investors were now demanding the highest ever premium to buy or hold ‘junk’-rated Chinese debt. There is now a whopping 1,200 basis point difference between the bank’s closely-followed JACI China high yield index and a similar index of investment grade AA-rated local Chinese market bonds, known as “onshore” bonds. The option-adjusted spread on the ICE BofA Asian Dollar High Yield Corporate China Issuers Index (.MERACYC) is also at its widest ever.

“Evergrande’s contagion risk is now spreading across other issuers and sectors,” JPMorgan’s analysts said, demonstrating a rare talent for observing the obvious.

And while today may have been “disastrous” it could get far, far worse if the market loses faith that Beijing will bail out the bond market.

“We believe policymakers have zero tolerance for systemic risk to emerge and are aiming to maintain a stable property market, and policy support could be forthcoming if the deterioration in property activity levels worsen,” said Goldman head of Asia Credit Kenneth Ho.

Overnight we saw the first sign of such an implicit support in Harbin, the capital of northeastern Heilongjiang province, which became one of the first cities in China to announce measures to support property developers and their projects. According to a report on a website run by Harbin Daily, the city will offer as much as 100,000 yuan home-purchase subsidy to “talents” that meet certain requirements. The city would also make more existing homes eligible for housing provident fund loans to buyers; the moves are aimed at promoting stable and healthy development of the city’s property market, according to the document.

The cash-strapped property developer’s troubles and contagion worries have sent shockwaves across global markets and the firm has already missed payments on dollar bonds, worth a combined $131 million, that were due on Sept. 23 and Sept. 29.

While China’s property sector turmoil has so far been contained to the bond market, tensions amid offshore bonds could soon create headaches for the country’s equity traders, according to Gilbert Wong, head of Asia quantitative research at Morgan Stanley. High-yield credit spreads over comparable Treasuries are the widest on record — at about 1,866 basis points on an option-adjusted basis, data compiled by Bloomberg as of Friday show.  But a measure of stock volatility has actually fallen so far this month.

Still, the pair has shown a close relationship in recent years, which suggests their divergence may not last. In the end, a crash in the stock market, where hundreds of millions of Chinese residents are invested, may be just the kick Beijing needs to wake it out of its no bailout stupor.
