As the COVID-19 outbreak continues in Shanghai, China, officials in Shanghai issued enhanced preventive and control measures late at night on March 12, requiring people not to leave Shanghai unless necessary. And those leaving Shanghai to have a nucleic acid test report within 48 hours. The Shanghai long-distance bus terminal is closed from today.
