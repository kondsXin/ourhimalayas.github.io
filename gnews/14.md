**郭文贵
Miles Guo**

七哥就有背后的高人，我才一次次敢自信说你们不了解爆料革命的力量
Because Miles has masters behind me, and I dare to say again and again with confidence that you do not understand the power of the whistleblower movement

昨天是把我也给惊住了啊，我几天心情说实在话
Yesterday, I was shocked too, be honest with you that I was in a real melancholy for a few days

你们不知道我把我过去一年来没流的水全都流出来了
You don’t know that I cried a lot, I cried more than all the tears in the past year

我大概从1991年之后，我从来没见过我八弟弟照片
I have never seen a photo of my eighth younger brother since 1991

这个照片当中当时就是我八九岁的时候啊，七哥还是处男之前啊
In this photo, I was about eight or nine years old and I was still a virgin

这是唯一的照片，还有另外一张是我和我一个发小照的照片
This is the only photo, and there is another photo of me with a my childhood friend

当时我还踩着那个东北的划着脚划子，当年的东北我记得十一月十二月的时候
At that time, I was still stepping on the foot sliders（on ice） in the Northeast of China, I remember it was around November or December that year

零下三十五到四十度的时候，我站在那穿照片，我穿着穿着那个夹克衣衫啊
At minus thirty-five to forty degrees celsius, I was standing there wearing that jacket

就是擤大鼻涕那种的，呃，锃亮的那种的，我也几十年四十来年没看过我那时候的照片了
It’s the kind of running nose and wiped with my two sleeves, I haven’t seen my photos since then for forty some years

呃，这两张照片对我感触太深了，就控制不住的流水啊，眼泪啊
Uh, these two photos touched me too deeply, and I couldn’t control the running of tears

哎呀，我是这几天就想人生啊，真是四十几年前
Oops, I’ve been thinking about life these few days, it was more than forty years ago

当时我的八弟还有我还有我当时的样子和当时的赵家沟啊
At that time, my eighth younger brother, me, and my appearance in Zhaojiagou at that time

我在同时和这世界上数字货币的大佬创始人通话
at the same time I was on the phone with the founder of the world’s biggest digital currency

然后讨论灭掉共产党，拯救现在人类
Then we discussed to take down the Chinese Communist Party and saving the current human beings

你说这人格得多分裂，你还能受得了啊，是吧
You see how split the personality is, can you understand?

满大鼻涕大郭七儿，当年八九岁踩着脚划子，照了两张相
Miles with full of snot, I was eight or nine years old and was stepping on my foot sliders（on ice）, and took two pictures

然后旁边的弟弟已经没了啊，这位大师给我说，他为啥我要跟你点赞
Then the younger brother next to me was gone, and this master told me, why should I give you the thumbs up?

他说可以告诉你，香港的和大陆的房地产还有香港的股票市场
He said that I can tell you that the real estate in Hong Kong and the mainland China and the stock market in Hong Kong

他说我他们所有的数据我都知道，它从过去的百分之七到百分之十一的造假
He said I knew all their data, they have falsified from 7% to 11% in the past

现在已经达到三十五了，它说明他们真完了
It’s reached 35% now, and that means they’re done

他在最后，所有数字货币啊，包括比特币成零的时候
In the end, all digital currencies, including Bitcoin when it becomes zero

只有喜联储, 他说，成为世界上最牛的，包括你的Gettr Pay
he said that only Himalaya Exchange will be the best in the world, including your Gettr Pay

他说不是这个数字货币牛，是你重新书写了数字货币的游戏规则
He said it wasn’t this digital currency outstanding, it was you who rewrote the rules of the digital currency game

共产党的房地产将成就人类上第二次最大的金融形式的存在
The real estate of the Chinese Communist Party will achieve of the second largest form of financial existence on mankind

他死之前给人类留下了最后一点贡献，把他的骨灰变成了人类文明的肥料
Before it death, it will leave its last contribution to mankind, turning its ashes into the fertilizer of human civilization

那就是成就了数字货币
That is the achievement of digital currency
