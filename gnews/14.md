**郭文贵
Miles Guo**

记住啊，为啥我刚才问你们这个时间点
Remember, why did I just ask you this time point

这位战友告诉我，把我笑坏了，
This comrade-in-arms told me that it made me laugh so badly

10月3号它是在哪上市，你知道吗？蚂蚁金服，
do you know where Ant Financial was listed on October 3rd?

它是在香港上市，然后再在上海上市
it was listed in Hong Kong, and then back to Shanghai

在这之前，马云已经实际上被限制出境了，出境要报备
Prior to this, Jack Ma had actually been restricted from leaving the country, and he had to report before leaving the country

你家人出，你不能出，你出，你家人不能出
Your family member go abroad, you can’t go with them, and you go abroad, your family can’t go with you

但那一次，马云觉得没事儿，也都谈完了
But at that time, Jack Ma felt all right, and the negotiations was over

你该怎么上市，怎么上市，
Go public, just do it

马云就约好了说你看，明天香港上市，
Jack Ma made an arrangement and said, it was going to be listing in Hong Kong tomorrow

那天是星期一，星期二就在香港上市10月3号，
It was Monday, and it was listed in Hong Kong on October 3rd on Tuesday

你看我对时间没概念，这个我记得很清楚啊
You see I have no concept about time, but I remember this very clearly

就是他告诉我的，说，星期二完了，回到上海，在上海再敲锣，两次
That’s what he told me and said that after Tuesday then go back to Shanghai, and ring bell again in Shanghai, twice

这时候孙力军在里面挺不住了，交代了，说马云所有的股份给江志成的
in the meanwhile, Sun Lijun couldn’t stand it anymore, so he confessed that Jack Ma was the surrogacy all the share holders for Alvin Jiang

给江家、曾家，还有孟（建柱），还有王岐山
Jiang’s family, Zeng’s family, Meng’s family, and also Wang Qishan

怎么代持的，然后交代了马明哲怎么回事
How did he hold it, and then explained the secret of Ma Mingzhe

然后告诉了马明哲，平安保险，多少钱在地产里面
then he revealed Ma Mingzhe’s Ping An Insurance, how much money was in the real estate

保险资金出了多少，大概是9万亿
How much insurance funds have been spent？It’s about 9 trillion yuan

就平安间接直接投入到房地产的9万亿和移出多少钱
Regarding the 9 trillion yuan that Ping An directly invested in real estate and how much money it was moved out

然后美国的马云的代持人是谁，然后吴征怎么马云那里拿走了70亿美元
Then who is Jack Ma’s holder in the United States, and how did Bruno Wu take away 7 billion US dollars from Jack Ma

通过吴征，你们看到那个 Ideanomics 公司,一个就34亿啊
Through Bruno Wu, just one time they took away about 3.4 billion dollars from that Ideanomics company

其它几个10亿，8亿的，包括这个腾讯音乐这些
Several others, they took 1 billion dollars, 800 million dollars, including Tencent Music

吴征是帮助孟建柱，帮助孙力军拿走的钱
Bruno Wu took those money away for helping Meng Jianzhu and Sun Lijun

然后马云又如何在美国，记住啊蔡崇信 记得一个叫蔡崇信的吧
and how is Jack Ma in the United States, remember Joseph Tsai, remember the guy named Joseph Tsai?

多牛，买洋基，然后刚刚又在我对面买了房子
super, buy Brooklyn Nets and then just bought a house across from me

全美国有史以来最贵的房子，公寓2.5亿
It was 250 million dollars most expensive apartments in U.S. history

所有的这些房子包括在这个海外的170个项目
All these houses are included in this 170 overseas projects

都是马云藏的钱，洗的钱，背后老板主要是江志成
It’s all the money hidden by Jack Ma, the money laundered, and the boss behind it is mainly Alvin Jiang

这钱可真是大了去了，当时报给习，习傻了
The money is really huge, it was reported to Xi at the time and Xi was stunned

注：
2018年4月13日，蔡崇信經美國職籃NBA理事會一致同意，以10億美元（約78.46億港元）收購布魯克林籃網隊49%股權，且有權在三年內買進該球隊的控制性股權。
2019年8月15日，蔡崇信與俄羅斯億萬富豪米哈伊爾·普羅霍羅夫（Mikhail Prokhorov）簽署協議，以13.5億美元（約105.91億港元）收購後者持有的NBA布魯克林籃網隊剩餘51%股份，成為這支紐約球隊的大老闆。

郭先生提到的洋基是口误
